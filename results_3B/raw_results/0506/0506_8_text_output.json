The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the Crimean campaign\nMeanwhile, other saltpeter forts were built without any anti-fortress armaments. The fort of Saltpeter Hill (in Nepela) built by the French in 1756 was so obsolete that from then on, all forts built by the Austrians were given an artillery attack course. From Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica a special fort from under the chateau is relatively incomprehensible. It is not yet known what guns with what ammunition were there in this small fort built no later than the 1760s. An explanation could be found in the records of Moravian manufacture from",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pursued the North Koreans, with close air support by A-26 \" Invaders \" and B - 26 \" Avengers \" ( the B - 26 entered service less than 2 months before ), propeller powered and heavier than the ones used in Europe.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 764. What do the Yangtze and Kuizhou normally hold?\nA.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which attempted to cut Japanese sea lines of communication off from the port of Tianjin during the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Ships of the Imperial Chinese Navy posed a threat only when they were in Japanese territorial waters, where they were protected by the Embargo of Japan by the Eight-Power Alliance. They were more at risk from the Triple Intervention of European countries, which imposed an indemnity and pressured Japan not to punish China by occupying the Liaodong Peninsula, effectively undoing the victory of the Sino-Japanese War. In 1899, the first of several armored cruisers were ordered, by the Naval Treaty of",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous period. The family has greater disparity in morphology than any other placoderma family with over 20 tetrapod types morphology.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylumous structures is not sharply defined. It was shown that early temnospondyls were rhachitomous, and that in many groups this advanced to the condition where the vertebrae consisted of a typical arthrodial capsule surrounding a single centrum. In addition, many later forms show stereospondylumous characters, although the actual stereospondylumous condition is not a universal feature of temnospondyls. Contribution to art : McN.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

  "Could you perform an experiment for me using a jar of water and food coloring to demonstrate the immiscibility of liquids?\nGenerate according to: After a rainstorm have you ever noticed puddles in the road with glossy-looking oil floating on top? Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Observe what happens to the food coloring after 30 minutes. (Yes, I know you can\u2019t see the colors.) Let it sit over night and see what happens. Whenever the food coloring goes through any process that doesn\u2019t require mixing, it is capable of separating from the water and will float on the top of the water. Hydropapillalleration rates of the water will be reduced, causing the delta S of the water to decrease, making the water\u2019s entropy less than before the air was added.\nHere\u2019s a way to show even more clearly how hydrophobic phenomena occur: put a shot",
  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, literary levels, and tunes, as well as metaphorical constructions which, according to Yang Qian, remained unsurpassed in later times. For those basing themselves on cultural evolution, Du Fu is thus seen as a great transitional poet, a figure bridging ancient and modern, East and West, the personal poetics of everyday life and the impersonal, public works of odes and songs. Because of his status as a precocious go-between, much of his best poetry remained unknown until recently - the recent rediscovery, and translation, of his Tang anecdotes has brought the poet and his anecdotes into prominence.
