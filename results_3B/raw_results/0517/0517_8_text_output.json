They were somewhat effective.\nC. They were undisciplined.\nD. They were vastly outnumbered.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: The military strategists would have been pleased with their results to that point because the defending forces had suffered vastly more casualties, with the defending forces actually just barely holding their positions sufficiently long for their TAC units to have still made it back intact. The overwhelming force had lodged itself in the positions and stopped the forward baby step campaign",

He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be of service on Kinburn Sound, but were effective in raids on the Danube river at the Battle of Papa (30 August-3 September 1859), where they avoided the heavy artillery fire of the Russian shore defences while sinking three ships. The aforementioned battery intended to attack the Turkish batteries at Kerpijeri on the Black Sea in failed up on the week of March 11 but were evacuated back to Gallipoli when sieges tired to the advancing Russian army drove the British contingent away. Realizing that Turkey had insufficient coast batteries to man the whole of the Black Sea, they decided to attack together as",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was generally defeated in the Battle of the Yalu River.\nAccording to G. Bryant Allen Jr., the Italians \"... most decisively won the Sino-Japanese naval war with the Pacific Fleet at the Battle of the Yellow Sea\". Others brought an international flavor to the battle. George Gross points out that motivation to defeat the Japanese was provided by alliance debts of foreigners like Americans, Britains, Germans and Italians to the Chinese government. In the battle, the Japanese had decided to keep some of their ironclads at stationing around Chinese coastal cities to increase a psychological pressure and political influence on the Chinese side.\nMore than 50 battles",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Permian, and is the member of this group with the longest stratigraphic record. Like epippehids, edopoids have cheek bones, plates in the snout, and dentary bones that do not touch the tip of the palate, but abdominal structures are otherwise unknown for these animals. The skin of wound-up jellyfish images taken in ultraviolet light preserve important texture - but no colour - information from the specimen. This has been demonstrated by palaeontologist Karenos Stenner, and the images still bring rich variety to the fossil record. What taxonomic category do Edopoids belong in.\nA",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not well defined and not apomorphous. This renders the classification into ostoderms and embolomerans arbitrary and not useful. What may be a valid reason for including the above material?\nA.
