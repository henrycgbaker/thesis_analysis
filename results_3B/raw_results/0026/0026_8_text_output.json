  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince no rules had been established before about which pups get where, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima share theobia with the puppies of the four roost parents and he eats with both packs. Roost Papa Jackson should most likely be Aragorn, with the double role of alpha female being divided between Shima and Kaspar. Beta Lana should receive Attila and Vicky.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous, and is one of the three species of smallest examples of terrestrial vertebrates. Another is the 183-million-year-old Bolosauridae. It has been known that there are many species of temnospondyls throughout the Carboniferous along with many more extinct Temnospondyli throughout the Triassic. Examples of this are the Protosphardiontiidae from the Carboniferous which is a typical bowed - legged, crawly amphibian.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous macrocostals is seen not to correspond to the distinction between Rachitomia and Stereospondyli, because some stereospondylous macrocostals lack a diapophyseal process and are rhachitomous, while some rhachitomous macrocostals possess a diapophyseal process and are stereospondylous. A simpler approach to character evolution is now used. The suborder Stereospondyli is regarded in this approach as consisting of Tetrapodophisinae, Thrinaxollidae, Nefremysidae, and Telerysidae.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we make of the world around us and how we make sense of ourselves and others. Dr. Daniel Steinhauser hosts. Through the Eyes of People Who Became Convinced: The World Would End on May 21, 2011 WHEN I was eight years old, I remember a photograph of Pope John Paul II with awe. I believed him to be some mysterious and divine being. The closeness I believed him to posses was so alien to my corresponding level of experience that my youthful belief in him made no sense to me. This photograph also revealed to me how much the world is willing to believe in the holy and unnatural. (",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the line but these were driven back and less than a dozen are said to have fallen with the southern troops.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still write poignant love messages to our loved ones.
