  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was sent to China in 1895 by the Qing dynasty to help defend against the newly formed Republic of China. The Japanese fleet was victorious in the Battle of the Yalu River, which helped the Empire of Japan defeat Qing forces in the First Sino-Japanese War. The Imperial Japanese Navy became the preeminent naval power in East Asia, and would expand its fleet and influence into the Pacific Ocean. Japan went on to conquer Korea and annex Taiwan in 1910, and invaded Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the 1930s, the IJN commissioned a",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is based entirely on the structure of the vertebrae, with no consideration of other characters.\nIn the late 1960s, the paleontologist John M. Callow ( 1969 ) noted that the term \" rhachitomous \" was no longer useful. He suggested that it was a \" misnomer \" since the name \" rhachite \" ( derived from the Greek word for \" rachis \" or \" spine \") referred to the entire vertebral column, not just to the structure of the vertebrae. He proposed that the term \" rhachitomous \" ( with a hy",

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us.

You might not be able to compose a sonnet, but that doesn't mean you can't express how you feel. Here are a few pointers that you can use to write your own love poems.
