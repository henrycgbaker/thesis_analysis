  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these two groups have very different functions. The tympanum of frogs is a membrane \u2014 or disk \u2014 that vibrates like @-@ with the muscle @-@ pressure changes generated by the tongue action ; frogs are eustachian tunneled.

  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in this conflict but served in the American Civil War on the west coast of the United States and on the Black Sea. Glatton suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Port Hudson in 1864. I sank in an attempted voyage from Hong Kong to Wakayama in 1869, apparently the first union-casemate ship of any sort to take on water sufficiently to sink. I performed the task of a two ironclads for which Intrepid had been brought back from the southern expedition of 1866. The second-generation ships ( Ant, Vulcain, Moriceau ) were tried on",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Upper Silurian. The first Edopoid family, Battripidae, and the related family Eurycorphodontidae, appeared during the Early Carboniferous. These families evolved convergently from the unrelated families Trollimysauridae and Rhinecephalidae ( which belong to other superfamilies ). The true edopoids, however, first appeared during the Late Mississippian. Edopoids are noted for having a flat mouth structure, which is provided by the abductor mandibularis muscle.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous structures in temnospondyls is not absolute, and has often been difficult to establish. What may be the reason the speaker is commenting on the previous classification of temnospondyls?\nA. They were not comprehensive enough and needed to be expanded.\nB.
