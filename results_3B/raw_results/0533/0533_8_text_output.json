They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early 767.  However, they remained there for a further two years, at times languor and sometimes in a dither of concern as to whether the conflict of the period would, as always, force them to move on once again to cover for military conflict.  Du Fu could not withstand his troubles, however, and soon after suffering a heart attack he entered a depression and despair.  After his death in 770, the general populace lit candles and lanterns and some penetrated the remains and ate or broke them for good luck. There is no uniformity of form in earthenware vessels of this category. D",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not nearly as sharp as was previously thought. Why did initially classify animals incorrectly?\nA. Because the phylogenetics are not doing a good job\nB. Because the cylindric vertebrae are different in form\nC. Because they were searching for new mutant genes\nD.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \".
