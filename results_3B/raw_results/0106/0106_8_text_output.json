On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.

The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pursued and overran the North Korean Army and then pressed into North Korea. Why did the Americans decide to enter North Korea?\nA. They wanted to support the South Korean Army.\nB.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which formed an opposing flank to the imminent rise of Western, especially British and American influence over Asia.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not as clear as previously thought, and some embryological features suggest that at least some stereospondyls evolved a rhachitomous condition more than once. One solution is to accept the traditional subdivision into suborders steriospondyl+ and rachitomous, but to reclassify the rachitomorous forms at least a second time : some gomphostomes ( now amphibians ) are rachitomi, and some palaeobatrachids ( amphisbaenids ) evolved from stereospondyle + Temnospondyls morphologically more pleuro",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, the relatively open lines of iambic trimeter lend themselves very well to expressing love, which is why most love poems are written in this meter. Iambic trimeter is a prosodic technique in poetry, which includes 6 syllables (usually iambic, or accented weak and unaccented long) in each line, and consists of various foot types in various positions--including words that cannot be broken into syllables (such as vowels and diphthongs). Since a \u201cfoot\u201d generally consists of an \u201cupbeat\u201d stressed syllable followed by a \"downbeat\" /unstressed syllable",
