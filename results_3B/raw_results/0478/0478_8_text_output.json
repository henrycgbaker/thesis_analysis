The second part presents a model for the use of analogies in written materials, specifically in the context of an introductory biology text.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used during the war. They were used in their stead in 1866 during the Austro - Italian War. They had the advantage of being able to moor and operate closer to the enemy shore.\n The battery was part of the b attle fleet that was to \"cover the transports\".

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units took the positions and advanced across the Tae River. The South Korean units have been more thoroughly successful in conducting harassing and damaging activities against the North Koreans, almost with impunity. During the night, the South Koreans attacked a North Korean supply unit that had moved into friendly territory. The South Koreans captured 3 thousand prisoners, 45 supply trucks, and six guns. Why are South Korean troops more successful in operations against the North Koreans?\nA. They are being trained to this by their officers.\nB. They are not fighting the enemy on their territory.\nC.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was to become the Imperial Chinese Navy. There were also numerous clashes against the Russian Pacific Fleet.\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), Chinese and Japanese fleets fought a few skirmishes in which the Imperial Japanese Navy enjoyed some victories. The Sino-Japanese War also signified the end of the 19th century and the new 20th century, as Japan had been recognized as a modern military power.\nSince World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy had reorganized itself and modernized and developed its capabilities with new technologies including new ships, weapons, and aircraft.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. This clade of temnospondyls seems to have been relatively inconspicuous, as there have been no well - preserved specimens found in Late Permian and Early Triassic deposits. According to Bates et al. ( 2004 ), it would seem that the superfamily Brachyopidae would be basal to other temnospondyls, as it is the only group that includes the unpaired intertemporal. The clade Brachyopidae itself is thought to be nested within other members of the superfamily Trichondrodon. Trichondrodon is thought to",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is often very tenuous. Why is the narrator explaining the classes of temnospondyls?\nA. They are teaching about evolution.\nB. They are trying to figure out how to classify them.\nC. They are trying to figure out how they classify themselves.\nD. They are trying to describe them.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Most systems of classifying fossils are based on the physical characteristics of a fossil, not its function, like the system described in the passage.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the American perimeter, and at one point American sentries killed two Soviet doctors and their crew of mules, mistaking them for enemy infiltrators.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, \" from high lyric heights to wide range of lyrics, and in all moods, from serene tranquility to animated enthusiasm and from cheerful confidence to resignation in defeat \". Chou says that only a man of Du Fu's intelligence would dare write such varied poems, and that no previous poet had achieved so great a breadth of vision.

He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as witness for the prosecution at the Nuremberg trials ; and praised Jackson's early novel A Walk in the Dark as well. Rosenfeld concluded : \" The effectiveness of Jackson's prose is such that his novel becomes, for the reader, a theater of the mind : it proceeds as if words were matter itself, literally rooted in the ground, literally materialized... and \" you \" Jackson's people think and feel, you \" live \" their world and watch them move within it. \" Rosenfeld's reading is consonant with a number of other \" breakthrough \" readings in this area of American literature.
