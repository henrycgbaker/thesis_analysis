  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pursued them and caught and destroyed what was left of the 55 th Infantry Regiment and only two regiments of South Korean forces.\n\n_Excerpts from the Textbook : Bull, Tojo the Last Phase, Triumph in the Pacific_ Bismark Sea: It was even after they had crushed the Japanese on the island of Bismark that we could still not capture a sub.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early summer 767. Why did Du Fu stay in Kuizhou for almost two years?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. He felt he was dying, and had little reason to go on.\nC. Kuizhou was his favorite place in the world.\nD.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What did Du do during December 759?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. Du returned home.\nC. Du stayed with Pei in Sichuan.\nD. Du wrote farewell letters to his acquaintances.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: When in a hurry to identify the correct answer to this question, go with the references to writing. In this case, both references are to letters, so the best choice is D. In the poem cited, Du announced the writing of farewell letters, even though he remained in peaceful Sichuan. However, Sichuan is called Chengdu, and Du in contrast addresses letters",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which invaded Korea in 1894 in the Battle of the Yalu, another indication of that the navy was no longer the \" ram hulking coastal fighting barque \" it had originally been in the 1850s. Though it is often claimed that rebuild what it lost in 1868, \" the razing of Edo Castle and the burning of the Shogun's Golden Pavilion \" had a \" devastating mental effect on the Japanese people \" -- though Japan was never at war with China others have argued it was necessary, or that a contemporary indigenous tradition of craftsmanship enabled even remarkable deeds of armaments to be autonomously undertaken",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. Cochleosauridae became extinct in the Middle Permian, some time between 260.9 and 258.8 million years ago during the Guadalupian epoch. According to Ridley ( 1986 ), this extinction may have been precipitated by a meteorite impact. Admiral ( 1999 ), however, has long insisted that the \" first pause \" in the evolution of temnospondyls, which showed itself here, was occasioned instead by competing agamid and microsaurian amphibians. The pseudo-tetradactylous state, he argues, was actually a",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is no longer considered properly diagnostic because of the primitive palatal articulation in the Rhacoperoidea, a group formerly excluded from the suborder Stereospondyli. The simple vertebrae consist of just four elements, two paired side blocks and two end blocks, and these vertebrae make up the suborder Lysorhynchia. Similarly, those great aquatic forms with complex vertebrae, the four-part rhachitomi, belong in the suborder Embolomeri. Thus, the distinction between stereospondylous and rhachitomid temnospond",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, our heartfelt appreciations still find reason in the beautiful words of others.\nLove poetry was born when the poets had already emerged to be the true artist in society. The majority of us are not imbued with the gift of making music while we sway gracefully or moving on our feet with the rhythm of dance. We may have an artistic ear for melodies and words but we do not have the physical co-ordination to translate passions into art.\nYou can still express your love using your words. Remember that your feelings count. If you are bad with words, just paraphrase the things you want to say to your lover. Recite these lines",
