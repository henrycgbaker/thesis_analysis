  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear.

The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these groups differ in morphology, indicating incipient evolution of a functionally distinct evolutionary force. Similarily, it is untenable that salamanders retain the ancestral condition for jaw articulation because cranial elements of urodeles are similar to those of early tetrapods. Rather, the limb structures of lissamphibians provide evidence of tetrapod origin. On this basis, the morphology of the supratemporal region and dentary articulation in lissamphibians lend support to this hypothesis.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Crimean War but saw action during the Italian Wars. They had to be replaced in the 1870s by a more permanent version which came to be called \"cheese\" or \"turreted\" monitors.\n Since the development of the first iron rocket ships in 1859 it became apparent that the floating batteries would become obsolete in the coming war.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. His correspondence includes an artistic exchange in rhymed verse with patron Wei Quan (c. 732\u2013777 ), the most distinguished of the post - T 'ang aristocrats.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was destroyed at the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 17 September 1894. The successful vessels quickly became key played in naval confrontation with the United States, which led to Japan's expansion of operations to Asia.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is based on the presence of epiphyses in the humerus \u2014 which should not be used as a diagnostic character since it is variable even within one species ( Carroll 1988 ). So the original classification, best not used. What may be the reason for historical reasons for being the first to go after the identification of temnospondyls?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. It may be due to the increase in phylogenetic sequences.\nC. It may be due to increased humerus epiphysis.\nD. It may be due to carbon distance between palms.\nAnswer",
