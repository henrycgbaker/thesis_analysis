  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", and that he was worried ( on Hitler's behalf ) lest the book be judged an offensive attack : for example, he was worried that the average ( possibly unhistorical ) reader would not want to bother to work hard enough to study the text long enough to understand that \" the book is meant not as an objective study of ideas, but simply as a theoretical exploration of pictures. \". Steiner diverted criticism away from himself, and transferred any criticism away from his account onto the addressee of his book. Why is the narrator displeased with the reader?\nA. They find the speech offensive.\nB. They are upset at their failure",
  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866 to be deployed against the Austrians ; they were captured after the battle but sank a month later. What ocean / sea might these vessels be seen as employed on?\nA. The English Channel\nB. The Mediterranean Sea\nC. The Baltic Sea\nD.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had the usual designation of First Class. The Battle of the Yalu River, also known as the First Korean Expedition, was a naval war between the\nImperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and the Qing dynasty's Beiyang Fleet during the 1884 Sino-French War in the Yalu River delta. The Chinese fleet of 33 ironclads and 46 gunboats was defeated by the Japanese navy of only 10 ironclads, two battleships, four coastal defense monitors and 38 gunboats. Over the course of the day, both the Japanese and Chinese fleets were battered beyond uselessness. The",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Pennsylvanian, in what would later become modern Europe. More recently, Gromphadon was a member of Edopoidea, and thus probably the closest living relative of the dinosaur Silesauridae. The split between stem and crown groups, or the separation of parapodylids from shania brachsaurians has not yet been securely determined. The separation between stem and crown groups is thought to have occurred around the end of the Pennsylvanian to the beginning of the Permian, about 290 million years ago.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae was based upon ossification patterns, not upon bone structures. Lately, research has shown that the rhachitonous condition follows either increased or decreased rates of axial growth. This gives rise to tissue that is either wider than normal, as in Acanthostega, or more slender. In these animals, this tissue tends to become inflexible, and it can be assumed that such animals seek a watery environment with higher input of oxygen. It may also be assumed that the condition of Rheelodus is reversible, due to its return to the form of a normal vertebra in the younger members of the",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 1 25 mm guns.The 2 inch machine guns were retained in the deck openings. Three triple 21 @.@ inch naval guns were added aft of the superstructure and were in same configuration as on the Junyo.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the US position meeting a hail of fire from more than one landing craft. It was this that led to most of the troops slowly making their way upward. The North Korean artillery kept up a non - intermittent barrage until nightfall.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can nevertheless, extract good lines from the poems of great poets. One transcription of a romantic poem can touch the senses of a man or woman, but singularly, romantic verses may not be able to communicate authentic emotional messages. To transmit love, you\u2019ll probably need a team of two or more people. Different voices together can express more warmth, passion, and dedication that a pair of well \u2013read poems can. Romantic poetry alludes to the love life of a man or woman and the art is made through application of rhythm and rhyme; a process that arouses the senses and promotes memory. For the love author to be effective",
