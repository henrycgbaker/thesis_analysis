  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nDue to a short childhood in an unsettled time, Du - Fu was exposed to the sufferings of war. For this and his dissolute youth he seems to have had an ambivalent relationship toward Confucian moral values in particular. At the beginning of his career, he lived outside the Confucian world and was dismissed and mocked because of his admiration for the literati Han Yu.\nIn his youth, Du Fu attended the schools of Confucian literati, earning a reputation as literature's uncrowned king during the An Lushan rebellion.

He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used for the Crimean War. However, as the British had promised the battery to France \" forever \", she styled four additional similar ships Glatton I \u2013 IV, and these were used in the war, specifically at Alexandria and at Gibraltar, where Meteor had been sunk by a mine.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units entered the abandoned city of Masan on September 21, and the UN seized the Pusan Perimeter.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which threatened Japan's Kiautschou concession in south China in the aftermath of the Russo -Japanese War.\nBefore the civil war eclipsed foreign relations, naval affairs were handled by branches of the Shogunate's B\u014deish\u014d \u5b98 siyas\u653f \u66d6 osmshi d\u014dshiki, B\u014dei Agency.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Permian Period, which predates the oldest known edopoidean. It is thought that edopoidean restrictions on the origin and morphology of the quadrate bone allowed divergence into parabalanerpetontids and invisauriids.  Although Balanerpeton includes traits that are derived in the other Edopoidea, it is still considered to be primitive based on its quadrate fusion, a unique D process fontanel, its formalian medullary bone, and its solitary ocular arcade, which connects the orbit to the lacrimal.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls was based on the presence of two different types of plesiomorphic vertebrae, as noted previously. Moreover, a large number of early stereospondyls show intergradations with rhachitomi. With this change in strategy, it is becoming apparent that number of different vertebral incorporations have appeared over many times, and are therefore plesiomorphic within the present classification. The biseriata, with a bony connection of vertebrae and ribs, is not primitive, and has appeared many times in pre - tetrapod amphibians, as well as entering the",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we all know the feeling. Love poems are craved by both the poet and admirer alike. They can soothe the seeds of doubt in our minds and allow us to focus on the love present in our lives... Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet's perceptions, opinions, and emotions. Poems penned by a romantic poet are a natural contact of an exchange between two lovers. Love always survives controversies and pages and leads us to sit and contemplate the true meaning of life and love. Read all poems for love. You can write your own poems about Love using our poetry writing tools as many Beautiful Lightning",
