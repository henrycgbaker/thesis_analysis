  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these two tetrapods perform different functions. Frogs attempt to conceal their tympani, which leaves the tympanum well protected from sound reception when unfurled. The tympani of temnospondyls are less protected from sound reception because the tympana flaps partially cover the opening to the inner ear and thus are less individualized from the surrounding skull. Thus, both frog and temnospondyl tympani can escape predation, but only temnospondyls disguise the position of their tympana. 6.

He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see action in the Crimean War, but were used later in the Pacific theatre of the American Civil War, the Anglo-Argentinian War, Naval Battle of Santiago de Cuba and - after disposal in 1867 - those of the British Home, Far-eastern and Mediterranean Fleets.\nWe are faced with the difficult fact of Britain's losing her economic dominance (we were already in overshoot by 1950, where GDP was just under 2.1 times current GDP ) and hence the rationality (resource allocation) and basic elements (organization, cooperation, interacting) of Burgeoning Power Rules will change",

On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units continued to advance and captured Kimpo and Seoul on September 29, though heavy fighting still continued in South Korea.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765. Why might Luoyang be more important to Du Fu?.\nA. It was closer.\nB. It was his birthplace.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. He liked the scenery there.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:  Du Fu resigned his post in Luoyang because of the indifferent response of the central government to his poem. Du Fu had not been happy about the restoration of the An Lu Shan government since there hadn 't been communication with them, and so he resigned his post. When he returned to Luoyang the An Lu Shan government was in control once again. When the An L",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Du was productive, courting female company, and initiating correspondence with a large number of well - known poets, which in that time usually resulted in him becoming their good friend. Du and Yan Wu soon set off on a trip to Dazu, where Du recorded fameworthy scenery on his poems and Pan Gongsheng's poems on a Dunhuang scroll. Immediately afterwards he returned to Tonggu. In winter 764 he stayed there before moving on to the Ji ( modern Shaanxi ) in April 765. In spring the following year he stayed some time at Linzhushan in Sichuan. In January 766",

The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which battled for control of Korea. In all thirteen battles were fought between 1904 and 1905. The Japanese began by sending two machines to Kiaochow, which the stationary machines could not attack so arrises utilized artillery as their weapon.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous, and thus predates the genus Edops. The family Dendrerpetontidae include fossils including Rhinecephalus edentatus. The present day lack of members, which suggests the group went extinct over 300 million years ago. Dendrerpetontidae appear to become more primitive as one moves to Europe, for example Dendrerpeton magdeburgense, which may have been an aquatic form ( the affinities are unclear some suggest it, and others suggest it is an amphibian ). Although more advanced forms are known in both Europe and North America, there are no spores",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial, and the cladistic analysis of temperospondyl phylogeny shows that the group as a whole agrees \n Why did the speaker organize a list of temnospondyl classification in the arrangement they did?\nA.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we should pay attention to in managing our emotions. Do emotions make us right or wrong? Do emotions deceive us? Can we rule out emotions when forming opinions and beliefs? Or must we admit those are our answer from the off? Do humans have a 'compass' that we can trust? Will this 'compass' help create more consistent and reliable beliefs, and thereby more success in life? This programme demonstrates that sometimes we have no other choice than being humble and accepting that there are times when we are wrong. Then the full dramatic range of our human existence unfolds, and despite belief in 'biases', after all, even the change in belief",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
