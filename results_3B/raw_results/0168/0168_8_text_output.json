  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is no longer considered to be of phylogenetic significance. The phylogenetic position of temnospondyls is still not fully resolved, but it is now clear that they are more closely related to the early amphibians than to the reptiles. The temnospondyls are now classified as a suborder of the group Lissamphibia, the group that includes all modern amphibians. What may be the reason for the classification of temnospondyls?\nA. They are too complex to be classified.\nB. They are too simple to be classified.\nC. They are too large to be",
