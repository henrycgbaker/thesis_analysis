Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli.

The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls.

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.96%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Total System will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n",
