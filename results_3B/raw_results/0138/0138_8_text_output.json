They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 onward. These circumstances compelled a closer observation of the current political situation and events connected with Pei's ill - fated rebellion. For nearly a year and a half Du Fu and Wang Changling were at the center of a great public concern at the court on account of the political activities of Pei Zhen and the latter's general Xiao Daming, who subsequently joined his rebel army.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which supported the Kingdom of France in their attempts to take possession of various part of Empire. French ships gave such a ferocious battle until Russian ship escorted local crews from France in 1884. By 1885 the Emperor Comunic\u00f3 a public that he needed to completely redo the Imperial navy ships if they want to protect far-aways islands from foreign threat, and so from then Meiji Warships are generally constructed as steel - hulled battleships.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondyal vertebrae became less straightforward with newer fossil discoveries that show stereospondyls diverging from stomiatosaurs with rhachitomous vertebral proximal appendages.
