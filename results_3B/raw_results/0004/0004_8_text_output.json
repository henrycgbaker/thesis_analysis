You can assume that the input to the program will always be valid (i.e., the user does not try to perform an operation that is not allowed). You should also implement a method called isEmpty() that returns true if the stack is empty, and false otherwise. Use a linked list data structure to implement the stack. A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. In your implementation, each node should contain the element being pushed onto the stack, and a",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was forming in today's Liaodong Peninsula.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Devonian. The first coelacanth-like osteolepiform fish appears in the fossil record during the Late Devonian, and temnospondyls co - existed with these fish. The diversification of these tetrapods, including both osteolepiforms and temnospondyls, occurred during the Late Devonian, influenced by the breakup of Pangaea and a decrease in sea level. The first terrestrial tetrapods, the labyrinthodonts, appear in the fossil record during the Carboniferous. Some pre - labyrinthodonts are known, such as the coelacanth - like Eusthen",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is dubious. What was the reason for the author to believe that the classification was no longer viable?\nA. The author felt that the suborder Rachitomi were too broad and too diverse to be reliably grouped together, and no longer existed as a whole.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. The author felt that the suborder Rachitomi and Stereospondyli were not stereotyped enough, and thus could not be reliably placed together.\nD.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and one of them was killed by a bulldozer.
