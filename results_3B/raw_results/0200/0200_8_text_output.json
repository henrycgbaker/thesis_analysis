The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is based on developmental patterns that would direct new developmental outgrowths toward either single connecting rods joining all the vertebrae together in good proportion, or to fuse peculiar components behind the partial sections of ribs like anterior VLAN diff\u00e9rencier-type axial precaudal ribs among posterior neck and body ribs.
