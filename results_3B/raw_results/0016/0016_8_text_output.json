  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units had made good progress in the first few days of the offensive owing to the suddenness of the withdrawal. On September 20 the Chinese forces poured across the Yalu River owing to the North Korean withdrawal. On September 21 the Chinese massed some 1,000,000 men for the war and went into North Korea. On September 25, the Chinese overran Songjin, and the Chinese bridgehead on the other side of the Yalu River north of Sinuiju. On October 8 the US forces lost control of a 16.5 km stretch of the Chuncheon \u2013 Seoua expressway between Yech",

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until April 766. Du Fu had himself transported to Luoyang by boat on the rail - like carrier between the two towns on which he made his celebrated description at the end of his poem The Dwelling on the Slope ; and made his arduous, hazardous, but probably - wise journey up the Yangtze in August 766. We also believe that he was probably living in the Chengdu at the time of his death, though perhaps not actually within its walls ( that must have come rather early in July 766 ) ; and arguably it could have been even other places along the Yangtze in that first",

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which until 1895 had superior fire-power. After Japan defeated Qing China in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, suffocating Russia in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904\u20131905 and topping the list of building capacity and the number of ships by 1910, the IJN was clearly a powerful force. The IJN continued to grow under new admirals, such as Tatsumichi Fujita after 1899, and in the port leading to a large influx of foreign shipbuilders. The repudiation of debts was carried out by Fukutoku Komura in 1900",

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous. Andikeus auritus, from the Middle Jurassic, is the latest recorded.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is artificial, as several trans - species lineages have occurred. The vertebrae of baphetosaurs possess features of both types in different parts. Ammonites need to be classified as Bivalvia or OrtheyData - What kind of temnospondyls were placed in the Stereospondyli, according to the classification system of the past?

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still get ourselves in the mood with a song from our playlist or a romantic conversation by repeating catchy lines of songs. Here are examples of expressions of love that great poets have left for us: For lovers: Nothing reveals how passionate or insecure one can be in love than a short or long poem in honor of their lover. Especially if done by the beloved or her parents. If you asked the poet, \u2013 what comes to my mind first when I think of you? \u2013 there would be no definite answer: the range of possible answers will most likely include everything and everything that\u2019s in this world.
