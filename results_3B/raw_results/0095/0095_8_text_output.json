  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these groups are distinct.

  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to take part in the Kinburn Raid.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to late winter 766. Due to the difficulty of traversing the rapids in the Yangtze, Du Fu and his family may have reached their goal of Luoyang in 766, and had they done so, he would have rejoined his children ( who had survived the killing of their mother in 762 ) and met Liu Zhiyun, with whom he had served and exchanged letters for some years.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which defeated Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War, which resulted in the establishment of the Empire of Japan.\nHistorian Ian Toll writes, \"The Chinese commanders were overwhelmed by their adversaries' expertise and discipline, but as the war wore on, [China's] considerable numerical advantage began to tell.\" After the 1885 Battle of Tientsin, China was left a weak state. It also gave Japan a measure of ascendancy over Korea that had been lost to the Chinese and laid the foundation for Korea's eventual takeover by Japan.\nAlthough they were mostly naval vessels, battleships were used on several occasions to land armies onto the",

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the way of life of the wolves is very different from the one of us, neither the dangers of life in the pack, nor that of the first weeks of life for our puppies can be communicated. But after many mistakes, out of which probably many will die, Kaspar and Aragorn will know how to cope with the pack. They will form a solid pack leadership with Shima and Yima together.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Pennsylvanian Period. Dendrerpetontidae includes some of the most basal of all the temnospondyls. Among their characters is a head and thoracic region set more nearly upright in its longitudinal axis than in any other known temnospondyl, or the sauriauropods ; this results in a head that is narrower in proportion to the skull than in any other known temnospondyl. The skull also has distinctive features, including the coronoid bones of the mandible which converge in front of the dentary bones. The teeth are peg-shaped in the same way as those of Diploca",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms becomes tenuous as new species are discovered. The number of elements in the vertebrae may vary between species. All tetrapods have a cartilaginous joint between the vertebrae, but otherwise the vertebrae themselves may have a wide range of structures. Some have a simple body and only two distinct elements : the centrum ( one side of the body of the vertebra ) and a flange, a thin, fan-shaped addition. Some have a wide, flat body and many elements. The centrum may be connected to the flanges by a disk or bar. The joints may be flexible or",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the stockade and attempted to gain entrance. When the barrage ceased, they withdrew and lay down in the scrub, taking cover behind rocks and trees. During the night, which proved to be the calmest thus far, North Koreans advanced in small groups in an attempt to infiltrate the perimeter, only to be cut down by fire from the perimeter posts. What may be the reason why some North Koreans worked their way close to the stockade?\nA. To get supplies for their own army.\nB. To see if they could breach the perimeter.\nC.
