  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n Du Fu inherited literary talents from his father and ancestors. His father Du Xunban, a government official and Legalist philosopher, was a noted scholar and poet. Although Du Xunban was neither rich nor close to imperial favour, Du Fu was treated well at his court. However, Du Xunban was dismissed and exiled during the reign of Empress Wu. In 738, Du Xunban died. Du Fu was sent away from the capital to serve the empire as an official in 725, but he wished he could stay in Chang 'an taking care of his younger brother Du Junzhi.

On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units were scattered across the remainder of the perimeter, with some caught at sea, attempting to escape back to the airport. More than a third of the South Korean units had been captured at the start of the offensive though many escaped. What may happen in the UN counter attack?\nA. The North Korean lines were cut.\nB.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Mississippian. Several diagnostic synapomorphies are present in Edopoidea that separate it from other groups of temnospondyls, such as the form of the tympanic fenestra and the position of the nostrils on the frontals. Edopoidea being a clade in Microsauria, and not the other way around, is inferred from many shared features between the two groups, such as the position of the nostrils.  ---- ---- ---- ---- \u00c9tats-Un Many scientists assert that the following six exceptions are wrong organized fossil records may not be available for, with most fossils known for",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions in a number of taxa is the result of an analysis of semiacrilic casts of the fossil vertebrae, not of live animals. In any case, each group is now considered a'grade'of functional similarities, rather than ontogenetic structures, and each has been reclassified on the basis of morphological, as opposed to priory classification based on functional characteristics.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

The building will have 14 floors.\nCollacott holiday cottages in Devon are set in the heart of North Devon's beautiful unspoilt countryside, near the pretty thatched village of Kings Nympton, voted 'Village of the year 1999', by the 'Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England'. Collacott has been a small Devon cottage holiday complex for the past 20 years. Collacott is a combination of recently converted barns built early in the 1900's, many still have stone, timber and slate construction features that were once integral to the building of Dartmoor cottages. By opening these cottages we have managed to retain elements of yesteryear in a very modern contruction.\nThe environment of these Dartmoor holiday cottages is in the very popular North Devon area, close to a wide range of seaside resorts and inland attractions including Exmoor, North Devon Coastal Path, Buckland Abbey, Clovelly & Lynton - Lynmouth, Croyde Beach",
