For instance, plant roots were shown to produce certain chemical components that aid in the removal of the toxic metals, and they may even allow the uptake of the reduced metal ions. Other researchers have demonstrated the absorption of Co ions by cells, which was studied to compare the efficiency of different cations. Another research paper",

They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to mid 767, when he, at the age of sixty - three, left for Henan and then returned to Kuizhou, where he died on July 17, 770..

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What kind of occupation is Du generally most recognized for?\nA. Professor\nB. Author\nC. Politician\nD. Poet\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: A poem I composed a few months ago has set me thinking of the virtue and thought of an aged gentleman called Du. Though I was in Sichuan Province, this is the message he left with his poem. It seems to me that he was particularly peaceful. In my humble opinion, this should not be seen as simply a product of the time. To know the man, you need to consider his time. During the reign of the emperor Gaozong",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which the Japanese Navy eventually defeated, destroying the last imperial navy in China and giving Japan its \"expansionist instinct\" as a powerful regional superpower, and later forming the First and Second South Manchurian Railroad which China would never be able to recapture as the Communist nation has turned the Manchurian region into a dependency for its trade with the rest of the world. The Imperial Japanese Navy was subsequently granted authority to colonize Formosa ( today Taiwan ), then under the suzerainty of the Qing Empire. Following the annexation of Formosa and the signing of the Convention of Tientsin in May 1875,",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous.\n Trimerorhachidae are related to edopooids and contain trimerorhachid Temnospondyls were the dominant carnivorous vertebrates in the Paleozoic, and have many more morphological and functional adaptations for predatory lifestyles than earlier amphibians such as diadectomorphs, coaltons and sirenosaurs.\n Temnospondyls were often terrestrial animals.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not based on any distinguishing features of the vertebrae. Furthermore, temnospondyls are highly modular, with most bones consisting of more than one element. Is this a classified?\n  1. This person knows about classification of temnospondyls\n  2.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the main barrier and engaged in individual combat in which many died. What may be a plausible fact about the narrator?\nA. The narrator is a veteran.\nB. The narrator is a soldier.\nC. The narrator is on leave.\nD. The narrator is a medic.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: This passage describes the beginning of an infantry assault by the North Koreans.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still speak of our passions in our own language and convey our hearts in a way that a poet cannot.\nMy passion has its name, my name has no passion\nAt least, the man who put this quote by George Gordon Byron has his passion at the core of his being, even though his identity is only as abstract and inanimate as an idea. Whether it is first love, love for family, or a simple affinity for a type of lifestyle, there is a passion that connects people to something else. I believe that even animals have their passions and our needs for connection are rooted in the power of passion.\nWe have",
