  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.

The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 ( late Unguenal 763 ) until March 767 : if this is so, Du Fu was not even seventy years old yet. Du Fu spent the whole time that he was there composing poems and serving as a guest for two years at the site of a Buddhist temple which had been under construction. Hence it was at this temple that his long poem \" Weeding the Heart during Two Years'Seclusion \" was composed : \" One evening near the Yellow River, we headed for a provincial border, Chang's, how could he steady his foot.Common sense prevailed and peace reigned for only as long as Duke and Harlan",

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Temnodontiformes.\nThe basal families in the superfamily Trematopodoidea are the Tirghostidae, Trematopidae and Cochleosauridae families.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is unclear. The great majority of stereospondyls, although in general quite distinct from temnospondyls, are probably stereospondyls. The distinction can be made by examining both the presence of some kind of elaborate paroccipital apparatus ( POPs ), and also the relative relationship of the centra of thoracic to the number of dorsal ribs. It is still useful to distinguish those forms which lack PPC ( and whose positions would not place them in the Stereospondyli ) as extreme rhachitomous forms ( Esterospondyli ), while those with PPC but with",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we are choosing--why, when and how--and what makes the choice for certainty so powerful.\nRight Between Your Ears shows how people become convinced they are right and discusses the social costs of such certainty. The film is made up of five people with different stories but from a variety of different backgrounds. Together they are able to draw a unified picture of what makes people become convinced, about how much they believe and how they justify that belief. The strength of the movie is that we are given these different stories without having these stories affirmed in the narrative. This prevents the narrative from becoming a sermon or therapy that seeks to convince, nor does it",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the wire, but we avoided the possible spider - like radioactive effects if we did get hit by any artillery or bombs.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.
