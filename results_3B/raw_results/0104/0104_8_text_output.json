  "How can analogies be effectively incorporated into written materials to aid in the comprehension of complex concepts? What are some strategies for selecting appropriate analogies and ensuring they enhance understanding rather than confuse the reader? In this study, a task analysis of how adult readers stored meaning-based analogies in memory was conducted. The basis of this work was that recall of a misleading analogy did not indicate that the analogy was not effective or incorrect. Rather, the meaning-based analogy was stored as a single unit being recalled as such a unit and made possible the other interpretation easier to understand. Thus, referencing an appropriate analogy does not indicate a student understands the concept; it actually aids students in that process and is an excellent teaching strategy to support conceptual understanding.\nIsis Houri Shoroglieleh\nDept. of Curriculum and Instruction, Lynchburg College\nIs",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the preceding summer during deployment, so they were added in 1861 during the American Civil War.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units quickly followed them north. What is the narrator telling us about the Korean war and the counterattack in Inchon?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What happened to Du after the shoulder injury he suffered while in the army?\nA.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which comprised wooden merchant ships refurbished and equipped with firearms at Cochin China and Hong Kong during the First Sino-Japanese War ( 1874 \u2013 1875 ). Utilizing the only modern ships of the day, the IJN realized their advantage over the Beiyang fleet and again employed modern warships - the 2 against 34! Their bold tactic paid off, capturing large cargoes of Chinese ammo, war stocks, munitions and deserters. That victory strengthened the IJN's resolve to press on.\nThe Protectors of the Imperial Chrysanthemum had visions of pressuring Korea by some form of force",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous. Because of the scarcity of Edopoidea in the fossil record, little is known about this grouping, and little research has been performed on phylogeny or morphological studies. Due to in-cooperation from Odontosternid and Ceratopathops cladistics analysis has resulted in the following generic family tree of Edopoid : 3 ''[[Category:Template:The most basal group of temnospondyls]]''\u00a0[[Category:Template:The most basal group of temnospondyls sublist 1 - Eldididae]]|2 ''[[Category:Template:The most basal group of tem",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions is also not valid. At the present, virtually all temnospondyls had rhachitomous vertebrae, though many had complex ones.
