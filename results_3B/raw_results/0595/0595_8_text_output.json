  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n Du Fu, in addition, was a superb calligrapher, and much of his poetry has a beauty that is owed to his calligraphy. This is true even of his short poems, where the beauty of the lines, the sounds of the characters, and the graceful play of the characters themselves are all combined to produce a highly aesthetic piece. \n Du Fu's calligraphy was not only beautiful, but also extremely sophisticated and highly original. He, for instance, used what is known as the \" vertical flow \" method of writing poetry, which was quite unlike that of the standard court style. \n Du Fu was also a painter.",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be of use in the Crimean War, but were used successfully in the American Civil War, and the Franco - Prussian War in 1870. Although the French batteries were more heavily armoured than the British, they were more vulnerable to the powerful Russian artillery, and were sunk in 1855.\nLater the French ships were developed into large mobile ships that were equipped with guns and a range of light aircraft.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not clear-cut ; Stereospondyli include both rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms, and some rhachitomous forms are more advanced than stereospondylous forms.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
