The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late but engaged the Russian fleet in Sebastopol during the Altarchi attack in the Kerch Strait.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units had a similar problem with traffic jams, causing the Army units to be behind schedule. The UN failed to close in on as much as possible the North Korean lines of communication during the Panmunjom operations and, to my best observation, the North Korean communication lines remained extant and fed supplies and reinforcements to the battle zones. Why did the North Koreans withdraw their army after they had destroyed most of the these defenses? Why was the army unable to determine the North Korean lines of communication and cause it to collapse?\nA. The North Koreans did not lead Americans to the trap house during the war\nB.

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince in lack of knowledge how the wolves could live together in the dark, Shima and Kaspar form a team together with the wolves. They decide to try it out with one wolf of each pair. This team soon realizes that even this artificial partnership is quite complex to handle.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is unhelpful. Which of the following is true of the situation discussed in the passage?\n A.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we are all blessed with that treasure, which is the beauty of words and their power to stir our emotions. Do we not believe it when we hear simultaneously the music of a song that sets our hearts on fire, or the magic of sweet passionate words spoken to us by that one special guy. The words had an accelerating effect on our hearts. There is a magic and a destiny about love. Shakespeare, Emily, Cher, John Green, and many other have written about love. This train of thought at some point led me to write this post. However, do you happen to know \"how many kinds of love do humans experience\".",
