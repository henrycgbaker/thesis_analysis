  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n The Kung family traced its ancestry to Bo Gu which was not far from that of the Du family. It was under the reign of the Tang emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty that Tang cuisine was established and that Chang'an was given its final form. Therefore, it was logical for a Chinese writing on culinary topics to deal with Tang recipes since so many themes in Chinese cuisine were first practised under the rule of Taizong and his sons..\n \u6e38\u797a\u8457\u7684 \u300e\u5510\u82cf\u5473\u7c21\u5287\u9304\u300f\u4e26\u4e0d\u662f\u5c08\u7ae0\u63a2\u8a0e\u4e2d\u570b\u7f8e\u98df\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\u4e2d\u5f15\u8ff0 \u4e00\u5343\u516d\u767e",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in these actions. The sea battle ended the war with the Russians evacuated the base. However the inability to break the fortifications has also been blamed for the outcome of the war and by far the slow arrival of the British batteries and despite their baptism of fire in 1855 there would be no time to use them on the Italian front again.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had effectively stopped further expansion of the Japanese navy in the First Sino-Japanese War. Following victory, Japan and Britain collaborated in the formal creation of a comprehensive modern navy, together with special naval bases, maritime gun and torpedo schools, etc., as ordered by the Foreign Ministry, Imperial Navy minister Prince Iwakura and some other members of the Eastern Embassy. By contrast, naval engagements with Russia proved one-sided for the IJN with a disastrous loss of six cruisers, two torpedo boats, and two destroyers.

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the true wolf talents are not apparent for all wolves yet it can also happen that they take little regard to the hierarchies the wolves had in their family pack. The wolves should get accustomed to the rules of the group and get to know their own possibilities. Now everything is possible. Anyone can lead, anyone can follow. Furthermore they need to learn that cooperating with different packs can sometimes bring them in an unfavourable situation.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous groups is difficult to justify. Where this \" lineage bias \" caused later separation of newly identified forms, it can make more sense than when it is used to separate fossils whose arrangement along the continuum is far more doubtful. In particular, trimerorhynchs appear to fall somewhere between rhachitomes and stereospondyli. This diversity of opinions is, again, partly attributable to the fact that trimerorhynchs are unusual among the temnospondyls because of their \" self preservation \", so despite appearances they should probably be regarded as transitional forms rather than anything else.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, why, and how we become convinced we're right. Viewers will hear about claims of certainty from neurosurgeons, cardiologists, economists, journalists, astrologers, paranormal researchers and more. By revealing the psychology of belief, Right Between Your Ears provides a fascinating peek into the underpinnings of personal conviction and worldviews. It invites people to consider belief through multiple perspectives and remind viewers that the perception of an answer does not determine the answer. \"When we finally find the right answer, the end of the answer actually starts at the beginning.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%.\nRevenues are expected to be $698.70 million, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Total System?\nFor Total System, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.72%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Total System will beat the consensus EPS estimate",
