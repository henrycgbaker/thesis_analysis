  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", and for this reason one may conceivably argue that the tale is a modern Morality Play -- i.e., the fable told in the context of religious didacticism. What may have inspired the writer of this book?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. The concepts of religious didacticism.\nC. The argument that each speech is similar.\nD. The criticism of the book.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Comparisons and Contrasts When you study two things that are in some way alike or different, you make comparisons and contrasts.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used in the Crimean campaign, but would return to service in the American Civil War. Why are the French floating batteries important to the modern world?\nA. They were used in the Civil War.\nB. They were used in World War I.\nC. They were used in the Battle of Kinburn.\nD. They were used in the Italian War.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Sea-going ironclads were used during the American Civil War beginning in late 1862. During the Crimean War, floating batteries heavily damaged the Russian Forts near Balaclava in 1854, helping the onset of",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units followed hot on their heels and reached the Imjin River on September 20. What may be the cause of their surprise being discovered?\nA. They abandoned their troops and fled.\nB. The US was waiting for them to move.\nC. They trusted in the map.\nD. They were hiding in a forest.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: They start with the results. The UN counterattack at Incho moved downstream, away from the navgational chokepoint of the Han River.

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 767 until February 769, when Du Fu finally left for his native city.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What prompted the poet, Du Mu, to move from one place to another?\nA. He could not stand the hint of a good poem.\nB. His government position only lasted a year.\nC. He was being forced out of the place.\nD.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which sought to take Shanghai in the Battle of the Yalu River. Fighting amongst its own forces of 1852 or its allies in the Anglo-Zulu War, the Undefeated steamship was targeted and sunk by a single shot from the ironclad RedShips containing a re-targeted Southern Cross rounds.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has to be somewhat ambiguous --- many rhachitomous species have steroid elements at the back of the vertebrae. The complex rhachitomus form common in advanced groups of rhachitomous temnospondyls was probably homoplastic, occurring as a side effect of the evolution of advanced body proportions, rather than an adaptation. What may be the reason for using a phylogenetic classification?\nA. Because van der Hart and Lomholt revived it as an arachnid classification.\nB. Because it enriches the classification of cartilaginous fishes.\nC. Because it made ancient animals as",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the dugouts.

Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Then add a drop of vegetable oil. Is the food coloring mixed with the water or in the oil? Mix them around.\nWell it is either by explaining the immiscibility of certain dissimilar liquids, or assuming that a water molecule and an oil molecule are really playing a Pick Up Stix game, or brazenly ignoring the question.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, Pat Sajaks have found this work to be very enlightening. When you have a crush on that special person, you can use these lines to describe your feelings. Just make sure that it\u2019s original as they don\u2019t want someone to mistake your careful work for plagiarism. If you don\u2019t have the talent to write lines, then borrow from someone who does. Romantic poetry and lyrical poetry is a broad phrase, but what my teacher meant was a poem that a man or women write about romantic figures of God such as angels and the colleagues of the Bible. * Word choice and utilization: If a certain word is not a randomized",
