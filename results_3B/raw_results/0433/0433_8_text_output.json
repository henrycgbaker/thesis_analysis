They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ).

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Carboniferous period.159 references found in Wikipedia, dasselbe Pageanreiche in der weiteren Navigationsleiste.599 links auf der Seite. 47 auf dieser seite in der linksen Navigationsleiste, dass die Gesamtanzahl von links von 236 links in der Datei besteht. 427 links in der Datei Titel Ank.\n806! <!

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous Temnospondyls, as well as the clade Temnospondyli, is of contemporary origin. Some palaeontologists argue that the only alternative to this dichotomy is paraphyly, and that the suborder Stereospondyli is artificial. Considering this, the present nomenclature will be analysised. What may be gained regarding these Temmospondyls?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. They are like other tetrapods in their anatomy.\nC. Their origin is being studied.\nD. They are organisms that once existed.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Aquatic",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter. Why would their more recent approach be so alarming for the soldiers?\nA. Because the soldiers thought it safer for them.\nB. Because the trenches are being dug by locals.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, love letters and cards will never cease to allow us to write about our feelings toward somebody.\nMany of the sweetest love poems below as well as other enduring love quotes express the pure passion of love, how the feeling can be overpowering, and how it expands the horizons of romantic imaginations.\nAt first sight, poets were eager to admiration in the most vivid and appealing form.
