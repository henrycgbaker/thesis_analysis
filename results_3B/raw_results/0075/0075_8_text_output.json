Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n Du revalorized poets as a learned profession trumping Confucians and Taoists, and focused more on emotions. Du is one of the most read and studied poets in Chinese history. Some of his poems, such as \" Description of the Xiang River \", have been compared with poetry of Ben Jonson or Dylan Thomas. \n His poems about other people's experience reaching great heights of descriptive matter, and harmony of rhyme ; his poems on autobiographical themes show great skill in portraying human feeling and expanding the role of poetry in expressing human emotion.\nWriteAboutDuFu.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Sychean era, and is sometimes included in Dendrerpetontidae. It is sometimes allied with Metoposaurus, Eryawigoa, Teratosauroides, and/or Phaydognathus. Dendrerpetontidae is the last group of disseminated temnospondyls to occur during the Permian, and it was somewhat specialized, having a unique skull with extremely long teeth that probably fed on microscopic organisms and/or salamander eggs. The highest and most derived Edopoidea are the three families living in the arid North American Mesozoic desert, namely Cochleosauridae",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is far too illdefined to allow any meaningful analysis of their evolution. ne? _____\nA.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and climbed on the barrier fence. Occasionally, live rounds or even grenades were launched at the lightly armed defenders but, with Werner on guard detail armed only with a hand - held bazooka, few ever penetrated the\ndefenses. Only two songs were heard throughout the day, are songs in the company officers corps of the 69th forward artillery artillery Battalion : \" Oh, you turtles, we will never give up. \" Over and over they sang that song to sustain the company spirits under the pressure.
