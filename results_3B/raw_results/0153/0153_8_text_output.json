  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late, after the war was over, in time for the Paris Commune. The Italian floating batteries Canace and Asciugafuoco(s) were built of iron but were mount ed with wooden guns and did not participate in their combat service. The Royal Navy started testing battery armament in 1861, and chose to stay with solid shot and shell fired from the swivel gun. The line mounted battery boat of this era was rapidly being superseded by rifled breech loading artillery established on shore. S. Vehil had considered mounting fortified guns on his battery boats, but was unpleased after seeing both of",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondyl groups is not based on phylogeny, but on the lack of similarity between their vertebral structure. note that the rational use of phylogeny has now been used to group the various temnospondyls. |Before| 1 |The first group alveolatus Antarctosuchia ( mid Triassic - mid Jurassic ) of mid-sized arcforms with rhachitic vertebrae are given their own name |Later| 1 |Small oscillanine forms with rectangular vertebrae, which appear in the mid Triassic, classify themselves under the now extinct family Edopsidae (Geisleriidae.",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter. Witnessing this, Schmitt decided in spite of liberal and unrealistic orders he would attempt to withdraw into the 7th Infantry regiments area. This meant an eighteen - mile march through heavy North Korean mortar and artillery fire, sandstorms, swiftly dying wounded, and the threat of being bayoneted in hand - to - hand combat ; and, finally, confrontation with Chinese infantries.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the technical nous of his elegiac master, Quan Tangshi, to the colloquial vernacular he so preferred. For all these reasons, Chou sums up Du Fu's skill by contrasting him to other authors : \" His acquisitions had a breadth imperishable ; his taste unfailing ; his mastery supreme, never excelled by anyone. \" \" Written on Cei Xian, nee Jia Yu, nee Su Yu, nee Wang Lake, nee Bo Xibei, nee Cuowu Shaoshi. \" Chou, p. 19 Du Fu cited by Unschuld in",

He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as a Jewish semi -gentile character ; he combined the \" violent unease \" that Rosenfeld finds in Elie Wiesel's Night, \"a resistance fighter who lost his entire family in Auschwitz \", a role that Lieber now assumes in the book. His \" dark alter ego \" was a conduit for \" evil sprung from his most experienced evil.
