  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see action there. The Brazilian war at the end of 1859 saw the sole use of Krupp float batteries carrying 37 mm Armstrong guns with the Morro cruise of the Castelinho, demonstrating something of a thumping engagement.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which arrived in December 1894, during the First Sino-Japanese War, which was followed by fierce battles at landing at Weihaiwei in May 1895, and by the regulation of the Yellow Sea. Some 30,000 sailors and 24,000 officers competed in these wars. Nevertheless, they lost to the Koreans in 1871, and the Russians in 1863 and 1864, when the IJN had only three ships with twelve oar warships taking part.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the two pups have an enormous territorial drive and a bit of a temper, things are less easy than expected at first. Because the pack meters are smaller than expected at first, the whole pack has to learn how to monitor and support new pups and which social hierarchy is necessary here. Because between a clan and a pack you have to differentiate, the vocalization performance and the choice of breeding behavior shows up at first.\nIn the end however, through all the ups and downs and inappropriate behavior of the two leaders, and a group trial, our little tribe just becomes a larger one. On the one hand, it is exciting to observe the pups",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Permian period. Dendrerpeton lat i terodorsum is the second oldest species, and is also from the Early Permian, 275-270 million years ago during the Lopingian age of the Guadalupian epoch.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondulous forms is artifical ; all temnospondyls have a rhachitome, but some show a shortening in the neck ( rhachides ). What will happen to the temnospondyls?\nA. They will be placed into their family groups.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. They will be studied and then transformed.\nD.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and were shot down from the trenches.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the exalted style ( sh\u00ecy\u01d4 ) to the colloquial, from the classical Chinese of the Chou dynasty to strikingly modern political coinages. But still scholars often cite Du Fu for his consoling depictions of natural beauty and for his meditations on filial piety ( \u5988\u7956\u842c\u6b72 ; mamao wan x\u00ecng, \" Mother Earth last reigns \" ). But his moodiness, which occasions the type of criticism that most informs Chinese poetry today, reveals the practical side of his work, exposing the subtleties of power and portraying its corrupting dangers.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as narrator of Schweitzer's dry humor. While successful in putting his seemingly tedious subjects into entertaining narratives, Rosenfeld faults Barinoff for his predictability, a trait that also prevents the true nature of Jean-Louis Bernier's explanations of why Schweitzer should not have let him into New Orleans.
