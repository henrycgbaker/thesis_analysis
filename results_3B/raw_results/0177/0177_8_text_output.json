  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Pennsylvanian period. The skull and jaws of Dendrerpeton show normal temnospondyl features, but the arrangement of their vertebrae appears unusual. Some characteristics are not found in modern animals, and may imply that they were an aquatic, filter - feeder. Dendrerpeton was a small amphibian, usually measuring no more than 7.5 inches (18.5 cm) long, though it may have taken a small fish as a prey.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not as useful a technique as one might expect. Since archosaurs share the stereospondylous condition with most othergroupId, it is clear then that the common ancestor to all these groups had more or similar basic vertebrae than the modern forms, and left to diverge. The Stereospondyli did not include all of the large basal-amniote mainstem forms, and included many strange, giant forms such as meisterans and melanorion. As a result of these strange forms, the Stereospondyli were often called \" transitional \" forms to the amniotes. What will",

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words or tech-nical knowledge that would make the straightforward translation of a love poem impossible, we can and should promote love through all forms of beautifying its pure expression. \"a long e on a\" synonyms and antonyms in the English synonyms dictionary, see also 'a long the',a long',a lot',a-lot', definition.
