  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 till February 768 when they were again held up in the winter by plain of Fullers Grass. At this point Du Fu \u2019s house ( they had at least three small children ) could no longer be supported in his litigatus, and he had to sell his meager possessions and buy more suitable - though still far from luxurious - accommodation. His correspondence shows that his income continued to be very meager in comparison to what he needed to support his large family. He was with heavy hearts unable to return to Luoyang, in the imperial capital, where, although he had enjoyed such a high and respected importance, it was",

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was escorting the Dowager Empress of China in 1894, and later the Russian Fleet in the Russo - Japanese War until 1904 - 05, when conflict broke out between the two. The Taish\u014d era ushered in the international system for vanguard ships and warships, in which ships were independently fought powered by diesel engines. The Yamato -class battleships proved to be the first mass-produced \" super battleships \" in the world and combat ability of the Imperial Japanese Navy grew.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince 1999, I have been photographing various packs of wolves in their homes--dens, fighting places, and natural surroundings. There is a fresh feeling, spying them without being seen, being part of a big group, or observing lonely individuals. At first, only one small part was complete, the parts that deal with wolves. But each is a chapter in a larger story. There is always something missing. I was motivated by the idea to photograph the entire subject and world of the wolves from the viewpoint of a pack member, within the environment of the den. I feel that the point of lesser, individual scores is larger when making",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has become blurred. But the distinction between two suborders should remain in phylogenetic nomenclature. The suborder Rachitomi should include all early forms with complex vertebral elements and most primitive forms with one appearence of a rachischondral foram, the common intercentra of amphibians. [ \"Stereospondyli\" has served as a misnomer, since by the 1970s it was evident that stereospondyl skull shape and manner of life were not enough to define a group of ectothermic amphibians.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

This disperses the food coloring particles in the water so evenly that there is no visual pattern. Now put more and more food coloring (along with some water) in, but continue shaking well. When you are satisfied that all the food coloring is in the water, stop shaking. You will notice that the color separates in a pattern: the food coloring has formed (miscible) layers (called layers because there is one layer of water and another of food coloring). As you add more food coloring, however, some of the water goes with the lower layer of food coloring.\nEven more weirdness",
  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the casual conversation of a Taoist peasant to the most erudite philosophical speculation. These include language associated with such inventive verse as regular farce, aphorism, and formal narrative. Du Fu came to own every conceivable Chinese word, often producing poems that paraphrase an entire Confucian classic. His 582 most famous poem, \" The Bulwarks of the Pass \" written about his experience in the Siege of Changan, uses nearly two - thirds of the Chinese characters known during his lifetime. He vastly enriched commonly used phrases by inventing dozens which are recognizable to every student of Chinese today. How does this person define",
