  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had invaded Korea in 1894, and in the subsequent war with Russia in 1904-05. The IJN then developed its own heavy cruisers and battleships, which were designed to be as fast as possible, while still being able to fight other battleships. The IJN's 1st Fleet, commanded by Admiral Heihachiro Togo, was the first to employ the torpedo in naval warfare, in the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not as clear as once thought. The stereospondylous condition is found in many primitive temnospondyls, and the rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive stereospondyls. The basic distinction between the two groups is now considered to be the presence or absence of an intercentrum. This is a small, separate bone found between the neural and centrum of the vertebrae, and is not found in most temnospondyls. Rhachitomous forms have an intercentrum, and stereospondylous forms do not. [ www. wikipedia. org",
