  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units made slow advances, primarily because many of the US units were infantry, and were advancing in the face of repeated air attacks. The North Korean withdrawal pattern was relatively methodical. The several different North Korean divisions withdrew at different times ; the North Korean artillery remained at their assigned locations until the eleventh hour, when they would withdraw to the same locations on the Southern mainland ; the North Koreans withdrew at noon each day from their assigned locations ; and the North Koreans sought out locations on the rush dry - land beaches of the two harbors that they would later evacuate. Why would the US Infantry units make slow advances?\nA. They were assaulting North",

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 767 until well into 769.

He felt he could not live to possibly meet his wife, goodby.\nB. He could not walk around much.\nC. He could not see and a disabled.\nD. He was over 80 year old.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The fact that Du Fu relied on the generosity of others to fund most of his travel and sustenance shows us how desperate his financial condition must have been.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why was the poet in financial trouble even before he stered in Chengdu?\nA. He sleptfooted a horse and lost the valueless.\nB. The market crashed and his stock went down.\nC. His father went broke.\nD.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been restored and strengthened during the restoration of the Qing dynasty in China during the Boxer Rebellion and a few years later, the ships formed an escort for the Russian Black Sea Fleet to Vladivostok.\nIronclads and armored cruisers comprised the main battleship group of the Imperial Japanese Navy until 1890, when the focus shifted towards dreadnought or pre-dreadnought battleships being built in France and Germany. Several IJN warships were lost at the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War, with the surviving ships eventually being scrapped. The Japanese navy was among the",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms becomes less meaningful when homoplasious characters ( innovations acquired elsewhere in the [ http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade_tree clade ], then independently re -acquired ) are eliminated.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter. Why is the survivor defending the perimeter with machine guns against multiple attack?\nA. There were many US machine guns along the perimeter.\nB.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words because of what was once called \"Cold Feet Syndrome\" because we are adamant on delaying when we ask for our love's hand, those who are fortunate to grab the share of hearts of our dreams, should have ourselves to thank for their gift of rhyming feelings.\nRomantic poems are meant for people who want to express their feelings for a particular other person in love. They\u2019re intended to feel romantic and passionate, Good thing romantic poems have existed even before the actual machine that had worked as we call \"The Victorian Age.\" Even if Victorian Age is being associated with the complicated flowers a man would usually give to young women at the turn",
