  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which advanced into the East China Sea as the joint Russian and French Sino-Japanese War in 1904, and the next year were defeated by a force of Japanese and Russian ironclads and armored cruisers at the Battle of the Yellow Sea. These warships, led by the Japanese imperial fleet flagship Mikasa (1887), saw further action in the Russo-Japanese War and World War I, including several epic encounters in the First Battle of Tsushima. The Mikasa survived the war and was eventually used as a training ship, then a floating restaurant and museum.\nType Ironclad and armored cruiser, later battleship\nName",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms rests on, at best, loose fossil evidence. Why is it difficult to classify temnospondyls according to the structure of their vertebrae?\nA. It is hard to distinguish between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms\nB.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but even these attacks were unsuccessful. Schmitt was adamant about attacking South Korea again. What may have been the reason Schmitt insisted on another attack?\nA. Their tank needed reparation.\nB. They got no sleep last night.\nC. The tanks are running low on fuel.\nD. They need more troops.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation:  The best answer choice is B because they needed to sleep and were still on high alert.
