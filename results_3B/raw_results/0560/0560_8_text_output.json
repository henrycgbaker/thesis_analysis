  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was defeated in the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894, and later in the Russo - Japanese War. In 1904, the IJN sent its fleet to fight the Russian fleet in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima. These victories marked the end of the Russian naval threat in the Far East. The Japanese naval victory in the Russo - Japanese War, and the subsequent naval arms race with the Royal Navy, led to the development of a powerful navy.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not as clear as it was once thought. Why are they being reclassified?\nA. They are not the same group of animals.\nB.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved.

These poems are not only beautiful, but they also convey the message of love in a simple way that is easy to understand. Romantic poetry is the expression of a poet\u2019s feelings and thoughts about love. It is the most popular genre of poetry, and it is usually written in a free verse format.
