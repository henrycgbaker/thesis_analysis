  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units had to hurry after them, the main advance began on September 20. The races through South Korea were intermingled, interwoven with shellfire.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to late spring 767, then from there traveled by boat down the backwaters of the river and up the Dian River to the town of Dali. In summer 767 Du Fu finally landed at Luoyang, where he lived for the rest of his traveling life, making visits to places such as Chengdu and Wuhan while residing in the capital. Over his final several years, Du Fu displayed an increasingly obsessive love of an object that seemed more and more needful : the Yangtze River as seen through its city of Daming Palace. Today, those who have adventured there describe the Daming Palace as constructed",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What would have happened if Du based himself in Sichuan for all of the next 3 years?\nA. They would increase their income.\nB. They would gain a film.\nC. They would gain more support.\nD. They would cause a riot.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:  The paragraph tell us about a poet's five years in Sichuan (modern Gansu). He used those years to finance a poem which gave him social support.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was led by an equally powerful fleet of technologically advanced ironclads. The naval Battle of the Yalu River was the largest naval engagement involving ironclads up to that date, and proved devastating to the Chinese side. It was an extremely important engagement for the coming Americans to join the war after the battle. American naval technology and tactics were well received ; the Chinese fleet virtually ceased to be a factor on the sea, and its commanders almost all were executed for losing the war by making little or no use of America's help. The Battle of the Straits of\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd reminded the Japanese that their navy lagged behind that of the",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial, and must be treated as an approximation which takes into account convergent reduction in the number of vertebral elements associated with a progressive lifestyle in water. In particular, Stereospondyla is not monophyletic. In this arrangement, Stereospondyla is paraphyletic and Stereospondyli is polyphyletic. Furthermore, Archegosauridae is now known to be allophanodontid. The earliest known Nothosaurs are inclined to be highly derived forms. M113.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the Mayflower trenches and were searching for weapons. What is happening that there is an emergency?\nA. The military staffed up\nB. The weather is bad\nC. The enemy troops are nearby\nD. The food supply is way low\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The enemy troops are nearby. This topic is discouraging and inaccurate.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us.
