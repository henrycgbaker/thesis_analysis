  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not very clear cut, and many forms have been placed in both groups.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can do to avoid the pitfalls of believing too much, and how we can become more aware of our own beliefs, and the beliefs of others. The film also examines how beliefs are formed and how they affect our lives, and how we can develop a more balanced, rational and compassionate worldview. The film is based on the book, Right Between Your Ears, by Dr. David J. Linden, a professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of The Compass of Pleasure. The book is a New York Times bestseller. The film is directed by award-winning filmmaker, David Darg, and produced by D",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Now take a drop of oil and drop it in. You will see that the oil floats on top of the water and does not mix with it. This is because the oil and water are immiscible. In other words, they do not mix with each other.\nThe reason the oil floats on the water is that it has a higher specific gravity than the water. The specific gravity of water is 1.0. The specific gravity of oil is 0.9. This means that 1 cubic centimeter of oil weighs 0.9 grams. The specific gravity of water is 1.0",
