  "How can analogies be effectively incorporated into written materials to aid in the comprehension of complex concepts? What are some strategies for selecting appropriate analogies and ensuring they enhance understanding rather than confuse the reader? In this paper, we study the use of analogies as emotional scripts in educational technology. Specifically, we perform a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of constructing and integrating analogies with emotion. Our evaluation confirms that analogies when constructed with subtle emotion resonate more positively with the students taking the assessment compared to analogies without emotion. However, our results indicate that weaker analogies with subtle emotion have negative effect on the comprehension overall. These few studies suggest that authors of educational materials should use analogies that have both affective and cognitive characteristics (content compatibilities) to harness the emotional resonance that supports comprehension. Our studies suggest some important lessons on the emotional",

Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these tetrapods lack an eardrum. You are required to discuss the physical orientation of the tympanum and stapes of a presbyophasid temnospondyl in the context of its ear, to discuss the origin of the stapes from the hyoid arm of holocephaloid fishes, and to explain the general anatomy, biology, and evolution of temnospondyl amphibians ( including an explanation for the placement of tetrapods on a bush ).\nAroused Bachelor\nA discussion of the mating and breeding processes of a typical male and female, their possible reasons for not reproducing, and their alternatives",
  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", rather than a real person. He said that the book was not so much about Hitler, who plays only a minor role in it, as it was about the many critical issues facing the modern world in the 20th century, issues\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\u3001\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u767a\u5c55\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u66f8\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u3067\u63a2\u3059\u306b\u306f\uff1f\u3000(\u30f4\u30a7\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u8077\u4eba\u3082\u6570\u3048\u308b\uff01\uff1f)(\u3000Yeah\u3000]))) \u2460 as he leaded them to a decisive victory \u2461 to overcome the communist influence of the Soviet Union and to liberate the European continent \u2462 communist anamoly.",
  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Kinburn, but fought instead at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, where the Italian - Austrian conflict ended with a clear victory to Italy. Why did MOST of the army focus on land power?\nA. It was especially important to block the Slow Chinese Army\nB. It was more difficult to operate at short distance\nC.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. He often reminisced in his poems that that was when, as Yan Wei later wrote in his memoir, he attained the two greatest milestones of his literary career.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was the principal opponent of the imperial Japanese navy for most of the 20th century. The dissolution of the joint alliance against China in 1923 and the subsequent refusal to indemnify on the part of the Chinese government led the IJN to start to increase its naval budget. Examples of this include the light-cruiser 'Agano'written in accordance with Purchases not Ametria or Sunda and the Land Naval Convoy. An even conflict between Japan and the United States's growing interest in the Pacific escalated the two countries to the brink of war. Fleet action during this time included the Battle of the Yellow Sea",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is fundamentally based on \" bigote \" structures. How does the writer describe the temnospondyls?\nA.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still communicate the love we have for those we care for, including romantic love writers do perhaps better than anyone else. Romantic love writing has increased with the advent of electronic modes of communication such as the internet. Internet forums have served to be a greater outlet for common people to share their honest sentiments to anyone else who wants to read their comments. They have also written poems about love and may even publish them on blogs. These beautiful poems will probably not make it into anthologies but are still romantic and wonderful, testimonies of the writer\u2019s affection. Blogs have become an increasingly popular site for poet to share their works, either for",

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as an outsider and a bridge between squalid Jews, who yearn for a sense of rootless humanity, and the America of his own generation, which so pompously flaunts the irresistible realities of the global economy. However, Rosenfeld criticises \" the narrating method \", which is not objective and systematic but rather an \" unreliable and meandering pattern of intentional deception \" on the author's part about his personage ; he also criticises the use of an unreliable methodology for narrating the character's life story \u2014 because it limits the reader's way to freely build up sympathy for the character.
