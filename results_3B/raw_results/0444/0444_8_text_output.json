  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units then advanced through Kaesong and eventually towards Pyongyang following along a road that was constructed mainly with forced labor ; scorching the fields they found to burn their vehicles. The Suy. began to express concern that the forces advancing too quickly, and the general Suy began funneling reserves of tanks and other equipment to the front rather than forward them to the front. Overnight the supply situation quickly turned critical with most supplies arriving but in inadequate amounts. The relative lack of pressure caused the North Koreans to stop throwing their troops away and begin to conduct continuous resistance. The North Korean supplies were becoming more organized, and the attrition rate of North",

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why can you say he was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life?\nA.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which came under its command in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895).\nIronclad ship types\nThe term ironclad naval ship refers initially to the armored steam-powered warships that first emerged in the 1860s; ships fitted with broadside battery, such as the British screw-driven 1861 HMS Warrior. The ironclad ship type again experienced a major revival in the early 20th century with the advent of oil-fired turbine technology. In the late 19th and early 20th century ironclads were mainly used as large torpedo boats armed with large-caliber guns and armored for",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous epoch. Dendrerpetontidae is the most basal temnospondyl family. Dendrerpetontids lived in freshwater environments, and though they were small (\" frog sized \"), they are only known from material found in the Coal Measures of Germany and the Permian of South Africa. 26 million years after that, edopoideans had branches in the branches in China late.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions is often artificial. More fundamental differences can be traced to fundamental migratory movement of certain vertebrae, and additional support comes from certain suprapelvic structures. The analysis of this problem suggests two primary lines of divergence. The first begins with a small taxon known as Centralestadia ( Comparet, 1874a ), which includes some of the earliest known temnospondyls. This is the clade in which the non - stereospondylous condition survives to the present, most of the diversity lying in a third clade, the lepospondyls. Smith also points out",
