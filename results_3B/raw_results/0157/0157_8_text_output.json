The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been sent to the Yangtze River delta in 1894 to assist the Qing dynasty in the First Sino-Japanese War. In 1895 the IJN sent a squadron of ironclads to attack the Beiyang fleet in the Battle of the Yalu River. The battle was a victory for the Japanese and led to the rapid expansion of the IJN into the largest navy in East Asia. After the First Sino-Japanese War the IJN continued to expand and commissioned more warships, including the world's first battleship, the Mikasa ( \u5bc6\u514b\u6492 ). After the",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not supported by phylogenetic analysis. Instead, all temnospondyls can be classified into three major groups : rhachitomous, stereospondylous, and lepospondylous. The rhachitomous group is composed of primitive tetrapods, such as Eryops and Eryopsoides. The stereospondylous group is composed of more derived forms, such as the Stereospondyli and Brachyopidae. The lepospondylous group is composed of forms with a lepospondylous skull, such as the",

They use these pillars to make sure that every single film they make is a success. It\u2019s all about the three pillars, and how they work together to create a film. Each pillar is as important as the other two, and if one of them is not there, then the film is not going to be as successful as it could be.
