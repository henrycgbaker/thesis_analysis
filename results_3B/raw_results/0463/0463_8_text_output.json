The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Pennsylvanian, but is not family level, but in the family Popanillidae. The largest known member of Edopoidea is the Late Carboniferous dinosauriform reptile Obamiperator. The two early amphibians Metoposaurus and Mastodonsaurus are known from small fragments that are tentatively classified as members of the family Rhigarpetonidae, while Verniversalia velox, originally placed in a separate distant taxon called Bagnallia, has been tentatively linked to the genus Metoposaurus.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous Temnospondyls is artificial. Why did the author not accept the old system of classification?\nA. Because the new system is superior.\nB. Because it is already obsolete.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. Because the new system has advantages.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Although the old system of classification is unfortunately obsolete, it is represented well in this passage. The two old taxonomic families are the comparatively rhachitomous Rachitomi and the stereomouldous Stereospondyli.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can expect from others as we seek convincing proof, and from ourselves as false beliefs cling to our minds.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but the fire from grenade launchers kept them a hundred yards away.
