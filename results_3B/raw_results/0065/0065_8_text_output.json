  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nSuch works, he wrote, have \" a great deal of verse processing of personality and tell all sorts of principles and methods \". Although there were obvious social forces at work, as well, which pressured the classical scholar to conform in ordering society to established norms, there were against great pressure for many scholars to expand their attempts at understanding. Their duties in traditional society were often very strait - jacketed, and conformity expected, but creative minds needed room to expand, and the openness to such encounters as were possible within such a society fed a number of daring writers and thinkers to create the controversial, social and political forces needed for change. \n",

In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n He was educated in the school system instituted by the Tang, one of whose purposes was to tabulate gifted young talent and select a few for mandarin posts, while offering others work in the civil service system for administrative positions.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used in the Crimean War and so were used during the American Civil War, including against Pemberton's troops in the Battle of Hoston in the initial projectile of the siege of Vicksburg on 18 May 1863 and at the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is based mainly on phylogeny, a distinction without a clear physical basis. Following somewhat divergent genetic lines are the somewhat paradoxical conclusions that some temnospondyls were in fact stereospondylous in the stem, but that all temnospondyls have evolved to be rhachitomous, a condition initially restricted to \" stem tetrapods \" (? ). It is our view that this reconstructions is incomplete, and that there is a transitional zone containing forms that conserve some stereospondylous traits. We suggest that interpretation of the Stereospondyli/temnospondyl",
