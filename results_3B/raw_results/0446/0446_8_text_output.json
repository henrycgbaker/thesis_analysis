  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War.

They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for further use at Kinburn, but were used during the Second War of Italian Independence in 1859 against the forts protecting Porto Marghera, Venice.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which fought against the Japanese in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895 ), and the Russian Empire at the Battle of Ashigara (1904) and Battle of Tsushima (1905).

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has almost completely collapsed. There are now no vertebrate groups that could be confidently placed in these two suborders. The distinction, if indeed it remains, should be based on more subtle characteristics.\nThe basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Earlier, when I was familiar with phylogenetics, I had been told that my statement was the basis of the claim that the distinction was not valid. I thought that meant that phylogeny would not support such a distinction, but I see no reason to suppose that this was",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still express our love in unconventional ways. And if the constraints of a meter or rhyme scheme leave us puzzled, we can always pick out a few words here and there that really capture our feelings with heartfelt expressions to the woman in our life. Romantic love is a beautiful and mysterious feeling that prompts poets to write about the subject of their admiration, yearning, or even despair. Love can be a great teacher, inspiring us to generate new phrases as complex as the very emotions they represent, adding mystique, allurement, and passion. Wind Fanning Sweet Concupiscence is one of Shakespeare\u2019s love poems. It is",
