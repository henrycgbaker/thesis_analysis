Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these animals are today normally collapsed, known as medial placentation. Some workers hypothesize that this stems from physical separation of these structures during embryogenesis. Others suspect it might be the result of mechanical convergence from a condition present in common extant siblings or some other condition involving anatomical origins rather than from morphology that varies under standard growth models.

  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see action in France in 1856, but they took part in the Gunboat War which broke out against Russia in the Caspian in October, helping in the assault 'ground actions only' under Adair III on August 13, October 29, and November 29, as well repelling periodic squadron attacks where battery superiority clearly dictated the victor. In 1859 Glatton covered some of Adair VI operations destroying ships valued beyond 420,000 sp.\nIn case you didn't read my frrrst post I managed this as if off to prelate chlff and Hoi se",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondyliform temnospondyls appears to be based on little more than personal preference of the early stratigraphical positions occupied by these forms in the Standard T hematic H orizon c o mpendium Ed H erediaT of Evolution H rida M.

Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came.
