  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pursuing the retreating North Korean Army were supported by Troop carrier Command ( TC ) and US Air Force's strikes.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 756 to sometime in Summer 758. It seems probable that only at last did they set off again, after he had published another short commentary on one of the Qur 'an's interpretations in 758 ( a collection that also contains his more conventional poems ) and after he had apparently decided that the time had come to leave his native land for good. He died in the region of Chengdu, capital of Shan Shui province, where the administration had built him a house by that time, evidently to ease his declining years. It is fairly clear that he was still distracted by cares ( indeed, he locked his poems up in a safe",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why was Du so covered in regret?\nA. He was physically broken.\nB. He was in deep debt.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. He was exiled.\nAnswer: B Difficulty: Easy\nDu was financially broken. With nowhere to go, he asked friend and colleague Yan Wu for financial assistance. The poem himself is quoted saying the energies of his youth were drained away by many different people, and he disappears from place to place without stopping to see friends.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which took part in the Boxer Rebellion, before being crushed in the, finally leading to the opening of the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.\nIn the Russo-Japanese War the 1st Division of the 1st Japanese Brigade, fighting alongside the Russian Caucasus Army, was the first naval squadron of its kind fighting a hostile army.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Mississippian period ( 345.3 \u00b1 1.5 to 323.2 \u00b1 0.5 mya ) making it about 11-22 million years older than the next oldest tetrapod.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous taxa is so ambiguous that some groups have been alternatively classified as either rhachitomous or stereospondylous. The group is divided into two clades, the anchymallians, and the anthemids.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter until AFIs spotted them and fired.
