The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What happened a few years ago?\nA. He was appointed a governor.\nB. He traveled to Jiangxi.\nC. His had a son in Wuhan.\nD. He got a job in Cangzhou.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation:   The phrase \" in December 759\" tells you that it happened that year in the month of December.  The date in the sentence at the very end of the first passage gives the year; the author is talking about five years ago.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Carboniferous. Among the most primitive traits in Edopoids are the size of the skull, its general shape and the lack of zygomatic fenestrae, as well as excessively short premaxillary teeth. Edopoids show tabular fossae ( openings in the bone ). The melophosseuses ( close to the jaw joint ) are restricted and does not reach the skull bone as it is found in other taxa. Cochleosauridae have long and thin jaws and Complex Gonangosomes. A diapsids ancestor could derive from an Edops forerunner through a change in the jaw. Coch",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions represents a dimorphic rather than an evolutionary pattern, in that different species may differ in the morphology of their vertebrae without any structural change. abd etmenderece non\u00e1sa, temnospondyl\n\u4e0d\u662f\u7ec4 \u59d0\u7279\u65af\u6ce2 \u7279\u5408\u8bcd\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\nA.

A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we think we know, and what it feels like when we're wrong. Participants tell their stories: How did you become so convinced that the Rapture was real? What happened when a friend challenged your belief? What would someone with more knowledge say? How does our brain convince us we can see with our eyes shut? What happens to our emotions when we realize our beliefs may be wrong? What does it feel like to change your mind, and to lose those people who believed who you too?

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the bunker, but then pulled back in the face of heavy small arms fire. Why was the food and supplies almost completely exhausted?\nA. North Koreans were taking everything.\nB. They did not have them.\nC. There was not enough to go around.\nD. Nobody was bringing it.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The answer is C. The situation was hot and supplies depleting due to the situation worsening on the third day. Therefore, supplies were being depleted and exhausted at the North Korean mortar barrages. The other answers seem unrelated.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, combining the ordinary language of the everyday with the more solemn language of the scholar and the literatus. Kuo Bijan, only slightly later ( but on the basis of Du Fu's collected work ), wrote that Du Fu wrote in the style and mood appropriate to the respondent, the client, the standard, the provincial, the guest, the petition, the casual, the profound, the humble, the neglected, the gorgeous and the fleet.
