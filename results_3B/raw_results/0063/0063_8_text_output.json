  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late during that campaign to see active service, although Meteor destroyed the ironclad San Martino and its motor batteries before proceeding to \u00celes Kornati, where it sank Victorious. Two were lost during construction : Invincible at Plymouth Dockyard and Electrice at Mersey docks. In 1863 the French introduced a new 4. 3 ton ironclad mortar - armour - plated deck - mounted turret in service as the Fr\u00e9teur. The first British ironclad turret ships ( Edinburgh, Forte Diligent and Warrior ) used similar mountings, however these ships were converted to 4. ",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous Chillin period. Cochleosauroids lived until the Early Permian, the time period the ammonites were present. The most common pachypleurosaur was Dendrerpeton aegalescuj. The later pachypleurosaur Devonian Vertebra was a conical - shaped animal with a large smooth head, which was surrounded by a circular belt of small spikes.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms can sometimes be observed within a single group, and early stereospondyls usually have a more complex vertebra than some later forms. Why was it decided that the classification was no longer viable?\nA. It was decided by biology.\nB. It was decided by research.\nC. It was decided by laws.\nD. It was decided by nobody.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The information provided indicates that a researcher has recently taken an interest in microbiology and has modified their previous classification of life forms.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we hold true, how and why it all happened. From knowledge that comes from the facts to the knowledge we rely upon - and mistakes \u2013 we confront our innate human tendency towards certainty.\nThe search for certainty is part of our human nature. Nightmare scenarios can move our thinking from factual knowledge and to the comfort of certainty.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter digging foxholes and preparing to take the small fortified ditch.
