The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used in the Crimean War.

On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

He was rebuilding his culture.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: a certain historical figure traveled for a period of time.

  "Vikram and Shankar\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 has been postponed many times so far and it looks like the delays are not going to end anytime soon for this Shankar movie.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was supporting the Boxer Rebellion. However, while a total of 17 ships in the Battle of the Yellow Sea alone were lost for both sides, most of them were wooden ships of the First Line of Battle Fleet, the core of the Imperial Chinese Navy, while the IJN lost none. Though warships were often used in the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Imperial Navy continued to develop its combat capabilities with dozens of foreign cruisers, destroyers, submarines and a range of weapons. It was in 1895 that the IJN began commissioning ships of the pre-dreadnought type, making fully the",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is too arbitrary. Traditionally, the oldest known stereospondyl forms are the stem group Rhytidosteidae of the late Early Triassic ; the first known rhachitomous forms are the stem group Archosauromorphs, whose appearance has been dated to about 260 Ma, Pandorana, based on a complete vertebral column from the late Early Permian. This estimate is based on the body shape, limb proportions, and soft tissue anatomy of the animal inferred from the posture of the preserved skeletons. The oldest ( and I may add least well preserved ) rhachitomous form is Br",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can do to recognize our own delusions and change the way we reason. We will also be chatting with religious scholar Rabbi David Schnall about the experience of a clergy member in Harvard Square who quit his job because of what he felt was a religious message from God, and became convinced that the world was ending on May 21, 2011. We'll discuss how we are both cognitively and existentially hard-wired to believe things that are true. But what makes a conviction true? How do we know what we believe to be true? How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does it feel like to",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the wires and a few could have reached the radio.

Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of vegetable oil (or other grease-like substance) into it. You might as well use some food coloring or maybe some red dye as you are demonstrating the immiscibility of liquids. The oil does not mix with the water, but instead just floats. You may see a few of those saliva-like globules of vegetable oil and make an environment-by-the-numbers tv movie mini-series movie or commercial, but that is not the idea here.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved.
