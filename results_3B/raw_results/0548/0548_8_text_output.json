Therefore, it makes sense for self-financing home purchases while one's lending ability or credit score is good. For example, deferrals/re-finance opportunities are not as readily",

  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nDu Fu was educated at a variety of schools. He disliked Confucianism and its school system, and went against Confucian doctrines, especially those concerning loyalty towards the former rulers and parents. He later wrote a reformist treatise, Chang Han Sheng Xue, demanding that students were punished for irregular or improper behaviour in class. However, he was also somewhat conservative in that he upheld the importance of respect towards parents, teachers and superiors. Also, he never questioned the theoretical foundations of Confucianism, although he did question its ideological frameworks which he felt were detrimental to families and the social system. \n After the",

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was forcibly expelled from Taiwan in the Boxer Rebellion. In the Russo - Japanese War, octuple rocket tubes were used as the principal guns which drove the battle line between the opposing fleets. In a naval battle at the Jutland in the Russo - Japanese War in which the Japanese engaged in combat with a Russian fleet for the first time, Imperial Japanese Navy warships defeated this fleet by operations that had been previously successful in other settings. Although the Russo - Japanese War was ended by pre - negotiated peace, the fall of Port Arthur was wrested from the Russians and this experience raised the prestige of the Imperial Japanese Navy in Japan. cite",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Silurian based on fossil remains. Edopoidea was once considered one of the large families within the Leptospondyli grouping, but this no longer is considered to be the case. ### References ^ 1 0 00 - 2000 - Cope 19 70 - ( Choarc 94 ) Retrieved on 28 April 06. <Case Data\u00a0: \" not recognised \"/> \"Cope, Edward Drinker | Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\".

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondymous forms proved to be quite arbitrary and arbitrary designations of \" basal \" versus \" derived \" forms are still rampant. What is implied by the 1st sentence of the passage?\nA.  This classification of temnospondyls was only temporary.\nB.  The subject of the passage was a test of classification.\nC.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can quote lines from poems that show the power within its simplicity, and convey the pain, joy, and satisfaction we feel from obligations as a partner and lover in the most romantic relationships. While other people are expressing deep emotions in prose, poems have remained the perfect embodiment of love and help put words to our complex emotions. As time progressed and love as we know it today evolved with modernization and technology, people have adapted to new ideas of contemporary love with its ups and downs just as the feelings of any other relationship couples face. Love poems give an expression of things we are having the hard time saying perhaps because our English language and",
