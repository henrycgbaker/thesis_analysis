  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to have a part in the Crimean War but two came into action during the American Civil War. They were armed with a giant rifled cannon and in September 1863 sank the Confederate ship / blockade runner Tennessee with a single shell.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Keathian which began in the Pennsylvanian. Ichthyostega was a large genus of temnospondyls which lived during the Silurian. Currently, however, it is likely that edopooids and cochleosaurids are not closely related and that they did not occur together. Additional members of the superfamily are Brancasaurus from Europe and Carrollia and Yundlella from Australia. Agnomeropsis from China has also recently been included in the superfamily Cochleosauridae, although it is currently in a problematic genus.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous is sometimes obscure or non-existent.\nPreviously, most temnospondyls were classified either as rhachitomes, with vertebral centra formed of separated collections of centroleidea, or as stereospondyls, with centra formed of a single element. Temnospondyls having the vertebral centra composed of two or more elements were included in the \" Rachitomi \", the base of the classification system. Those with single-element centra belonged to the \" Stereospondyli \", which was considered to be the sister group to the Radimylidae within the \" Rhacitosauria",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from official documents to the ministry to letters to friends, each verse achieving, with technical resourcefulness, a distinct air and luster. There were also returns to antiquity in his language ; \" Du Fu and his successors, \" writes Chou, \" were really the first Chinese poets after the poetry of the Shang and the Zhou dynasties which had decayed without being taken over by any later poetry. \" Chou notes that Du Fu had a more philosophical purpose to his work than artists after him, and this shows in his choice of literary forms.
