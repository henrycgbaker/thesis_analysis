  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the fighting. The American battery General Morgan ( appropriately named for the Kentucky raid ) was manned by volunteers and served with the US Navy during the American Civil War.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was led by Admiral Zhang Zhidong during the Sino-Japanese War. The newly commissioned British steel ship HMS Iron Duke engaged and destroyed the Chinese ironclad Yang Wu in the Battle of Palawan in 1898.

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is of only minor phylogenetic value because most stereospondyls, including Lechriodytes atrox, a stereospondyl thought to be the sister taxon of the rachitomi, have rhachitomous conditions. How do they classify temnospondyls?\nA. They use phylogenetic trees to study them.\nB. They do not use phylogenetic trees to study them.\nC. They use a molecular clock to study them.\nD.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and how it shapes our lives. When a young student at Haverford College in Philadelphia discovered that the world would end on May 21, 2011, her classmates and friends began to worry. The student defended her beliefs, but as she grew more insistent and the day neared, her peers intensified their efforts to persuade her that her world was not going to end. They insisted that she was wrong, that they were right -- and that meant she was a fool. In the most recent and compelling instalment in our ongoing series, the University of Calgary's Science of Belief Project, we take you inside the story",
