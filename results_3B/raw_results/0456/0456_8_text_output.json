  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see action in the Crimean War, but were used later on the Yangtze River during the Second Opium War. The British built the St George Battery for the Russian Navy, which was also used in the Black Sea during the Crimean War. The Russian-built French batteries Galath\u00e9e and Amphitrite were also used in the Crimean War. The batteries were not cheap.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which, after its triumph over the Japanese in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395), continued to develop its strength through the purchase of foreign warships. Later in the 20th century, the IJN developed a number of light cruisers, submarines, and destroyers, which it used against the Allied powers in the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305) and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u201345). It also developed a number of ships intended for amphibious operations and large landing ships, which it deployed against the Western Allies during World War II (1939\u201345). After",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the end of the breeding season, there are just two males in the population. Will one of the six new wolves manage to attract a mate and to secure the succession of the pack? And what will happen if the surviving wolf father Katja has to give up his role as the leader?

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms seems to be largely a matter of size, with stereospondyls generally being larger and having more robust skeletons. The former position in the phylogenetic tree for the temnospondyls was largely based on the placement of Temnospondyli ( including Brachyopoidea and Labyrinthodontia ) as a sister taxon to all other tetrapods, with a basal position for the Stereospondyli. More recently, an alternate position for Temnospondyli as a clade, more closely related to other Amphibians, has been proposed. After a careful review of the",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can learn about our minds and how they work. What can psychology tell us about what makes us believe, and how can we become better at evaluating what we are told? How can we become more skeptical? How can we do a better job of separating truth from myth? It\u2019s a big question, and we hope you enjoy this exploration of the importance of having the right between our ears.\nBy D.L.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, there is something in all of us that makes us feel connected to this tenderest emotion in life. Love is a very personal experience and is quite intimate and complex. When it is felt, it is felt with all our senses, with our body and soul, and, as such, it is a very intense emotion. Poetry, with its metaphors and emotions, can convey to us the extent of love that can transcend the limitations of space and time.\nThus, writing love poems can be difficult for anyone. Love is very subjective and different people perceive it differently. Yet, one must recognize that love is a very complex emotion and not",
