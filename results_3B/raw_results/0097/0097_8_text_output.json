  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not absolute, as some stereospondyls have complex vertebrae, and some rhachitomous forms have simpler vertebrae. The distinction between these two groups is now based on the number of vertebrae and the number of ribs. The number of vertebrae has been reduced to three, the number of ribs to one, and the shape of the vertebrae has been simplified. These changes, which are found in the earliest forms, are thought to be adaptations to an aquatic environment. The number of vertebrae has been reduced to three, the number of ribs to one, and the",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and why we believe it. As the world ends on May 21, 2011, we are left to wonder: what is the difference between belief and faith? And what happens when we are wrong? Right Between Your Ears is a documentary about belief and faith, and the human need to believe. But it is also a story about the power of our beliefs, and how they can change our lives. It is a story about the human need to believe, and the consequences of that need. And it is a story about how we can all learn to be more compassionate and understanding towards one another.
