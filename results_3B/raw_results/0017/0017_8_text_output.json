  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the Crimean War to be used.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes.

Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to the fall of 767. Du Fu's poems written in Kuizhou here exemplify his sentiments towards the Emperor of Tang and contains vivid descriptions of the area which he came to love after an initially sorrowful loss. It was not until ten years after the Tang capital was withdrawn from Luoyang that he returned there on a brief visit.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which challenged for Japanese control of Liaodong peninsula around 1894-1895.\nThe Beiyang navy was initially beaten within Liaodong, but emerged victorious during the end of the Russo - Japanese War. The modern Japanese and Russian navies defeated the remnants of the Beiyang navy by the end of the Russo - Japanese War. The Japanese later seized Manchuria from Russia, eventually giving birth to the Japanese Empire which encompassed most of East Asia.\nAt the end of World War II, Japan launched one of the most powerful air forces in the world.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the reader knows two-time former leader Aragorn on the one hand and mighty Kaspar on the other it is no problem to imitate the process of a young leader needing to prove his abilities, while Aragorn and Kaspar search for connections with the new generation.\nThe wolves' world remains with strange structure for humans. Nevertheless, the authors succeed wonderfully in making out (i), that their way leads along Ulli Lanzinger's successful approach: \"Wolf Packs and Genetics\".

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions is no longer consistent, with at least one group that has a stereospondylous condition that presumably evolved secondarily from the rhachitomous condition. This basic Rhynchocephalia was at first thought to represent a diminutive crurotarsan like Stereospondyli may have been able to retain, due to the retention of the stereospondylous Mieldorfia, and Triassic seymouriamorphs and whole occurrence of the Rhynchocephalia was thus considered to be of an aquatic.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, no doubt either fresh survivors of injuries, although severely wounded carriers were encircled by the fire step and unable to move.

Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still bring out our own special heartfelt way of saying what we feel about the person, place, or thing that we place our love into.\nCourse Hero Literature Instructor Kimberly Fowler has decades of experience teaching college literature courses.\nLove poems have been around ever since people have been in love.
