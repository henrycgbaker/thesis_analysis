  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in 1855 to be used in the Crimean War, but were used in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. The battery in the Crimean War was probably the first instance of ironclad warfare, though the British had experimented with wooden ships armed with iron plates in the 1850s. The batteries were developed further by the British in the 1860s and 1870s.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not clear-cut, and many forms with rhachitomous vertebrae, such as the metoposaurs and the 200-million-year-old aphanerophids, were much larger than most stereospondyls. This phylogenetic classification of temnospondyls is also no longer viable. The group is now placed in a separate order, the Trematosa. What may be the reason for the writer's statement about the vertebral structure of temnospondyls?\nA. The writer is criticizing the classification system for temnospondyls.\nB.
