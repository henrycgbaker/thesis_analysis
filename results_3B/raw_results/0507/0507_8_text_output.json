  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was led by Admiral Ding Ruchang in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). The Japanese victory in this war led to the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) which ceded Taiwan and the Pescadores to Japan. The IJN also developed its own torpedo boat and submarine fleets. In the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), the IJN's new ships and tactics were again decisive in the naval phase of the war, leading to the Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) which ended the war and established the status quo ante bellum.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is no longer considered to be phylogenetically meaningful. What may be the reason for the author's classification of temnospondyls?\nA. It is no longer viable.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. It is outdated.\nD. It is outdated and no longer viable.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Rhachitomous means \" with a rod-like structure \" and refers to the presence of a rod-like structure within the vertebrae of a temnospondyl.
