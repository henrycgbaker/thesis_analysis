Please give an example and explain both from the user\u2019s perspective and from the kernel perspective.\nContext switching is a phenomenon that occurs when a Linux process switches its execution context to another state due to a system call, system interrupt, or virtual machine instruction. This occurs at different layers, from low-level abstraction such as x86 processor extension, up to higher-level abstraction such as the Linux kernel, and user mode.\nIn the user space, this is one of the most critical operations of executing Linux Kernel. On any system, process context switching is performed through a series of instructions or hardware registers that store the state of the process and its registers.\n",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was upholding the Qing Dynasty's self-defense efforts against Japanese marauding. Having accepted help from European and US financiers, the Chinese Beiyang fleet engaged the Royal Navy, which sought to prevent Japan from helping China.\nBetween 1884 and 1885, French and Russian corps faced the Chinese alongside the Beiyang in the Sino-French War and Sino-Russian War.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous. Dendrerpeton has been dated to over 300 million years ago during the Early Permian. Edopoidea is also the most diverse temnospondyl superfamily, with 11 families. The most primitive member of the Edopsidae, Lifilepsis, and members of the family Cochleosauridae are from the spectacular Triassic rocks of South Africa, Patagonia, and Antarctica that also contain the coelophysoids omnivoropterus and new protein names the Ar_seqs.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is uselessly subjective : most forms have a stereospondylous condition, frequently just one or two vertebrae short of being stereospondylous, although some of the most primitive forms present a rhachitoid organization. Where, then, do we draw the line for these forms? This is generally judged to be in genus Temnospondylus, although some recent studies have suggested that this subfamily be separated into two genera : Ichthyosuchus, containing forms which can be placed fairly definitely in the lineage leading to all stereospondylous forms, and Temnospondylus,",

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from eloquent abstract rhetoric to earthy colloquialisms that \" penetrate the heart \" as well as his more conventionalized style. And structural elements such as spacing and indentation ( none of which is required ) give a degree of painterly effect to his assembly of \" sweep \" ( veterans ) and inscriptions. The effect is like the full cloth texture of a shengshi-zonghui ( leading - into - unity array ) -- after which stylistic totalization is named. His poems have a pervasive unity that arises not from uniform repetition ( parallelisms and nomismata are infrequent ), but from the way in which",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words from the lips, some of us can write reasonable lines that the others will surely appreciate. Your love poem must start with a grim, herculean task: You have to intellectualize a human emotion detached from the emotion's cause. \"Detached\" usually means very sympathetic with someone's pain. That is often expressed by your tone of voice and words. However, when it comes to writing love poems, sometimes you'd like to focus only on loving and romantic expressions, so no suffering and dying are involved. The reason why love poems are so beautiful exists exactly because of their symbolism and understanding and not from the human experience themselves.",
