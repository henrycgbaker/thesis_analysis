  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear.

The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these animals were small in size by comparisons with viviparid amphibians.

  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", a \" purely imaginary \" creation more like the relationship of Stan Weylin's 1950 novel, The Last Hour of the Six Hours, with Robert Frost's poem, \" The Last Hour of the Six Hours \", than that of any historical figure.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used during the war.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had invaded Korea in 1894 becoming famous for the \" invasion of W\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32 \".

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Middle Mississippi. Initially it was thought that basal edopooids were found in rhachitom phantom zones, thus showing recovery of taxa after extinction and presenting evidence for late Permian extinction. [ later paleontologists have recognized that all forms of topophyly in Cambrian fossils are suggested to be monophyletic, and the earliest known one was only a mouth-brood -like thing with no real brain or brain case, and that Diploporites was by far the oldest basal taxon in the evolutionary tree of all vertebrates th\nTaxonomy.\u00a0 Evolucion fantastica de animales terrestres en\"E",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous elements is very fluid. Moreover, extensive use of phylogenetics has led to the conclusion that the subdivision of temnospondyls is no longer viable. And finally, use of systematic methods has led to a proposal to include and delete multiple distinct taxa ( such as rachitomi and stereospondyli ). l\u1ea7n \u0111\u1ea7u, temnospondyls \u0111\u00e3 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c x\u1ebfp lo\u1ea1i d\u1ef1a tr\u00ean s\u1ef1 h\u00ecnh th\u00e0nh c\u1ee7a g\u00e2n l\u01b0ng c\u1ee7a ch\u00fang.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius.

He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \".

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can all relate to the intensely powerful emotions that are beset upon us after falling in love. Many classical authors have expressed their passionate love in blunt poems that have lasted in both the minds and the hearts of their dear readers in the form of so called romantic poems. Though all forms of poetry since antiquity have served the purpose of expressing the intricacies of love that lie within us, a class of poetry emerged to shine the lights of feelings and paint the dark canvas of love experiences in vivid colors. The period of time when these lines were produced is known as Romanticism. Romanticism is characterized by (mostly) beautiful lines or",
