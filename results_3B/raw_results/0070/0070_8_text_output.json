  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was defeated in an engagement at the Battle of Yalu River in September 1904. In 1904\u201305, the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated by the Imperial Russian Navy in a series of battles at Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea. By the end of the Russo-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy had overcome the Russian Navy to achieve parity in its fleet, with an 11 to 10 fleet strength ( Russia had 10 battleships while Japan had 11).

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the young wolves already show a very clear personality in the first book of this series, the reader gets to know them very well. With Tatonga, the smallest one, it is a special case since he has the biggest character of all. But also the other four wolves have their special individuality. They are so different from each other that you would think they came from very different litters.\nIn this book we learn how they develop an own structure in the pack. These findings are very interesting. But Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima also learn that it's not always easy to accept things when you don't want them.",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Silurian. The oldest known edopoid fossils are those of the Early Devonian genus Cochlea. The most basal group of edopoids are the Middle Devonian genera Aneucolellus and Rhinesuchus. The two genera are small and have a characteristic \"long and skinny\" appearance as a result of having very long skulls and short limbs. As such, they are very different from the larger and more robust edopoids of the late Devonian to the end of the Permian. The family Cochleosauridae is also basal within Edopoidea, and also differs from the other edopoids",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms became blurred with the discovery that such groups as Stereospondyli, Trematosauria and Brachyopidae were closely related to the suborder Rachitomi. In the new classification, temnospondyls have no clear-cut natural subgroups, except for a derived suborder Protemnospondyli that consists of a number of groups that have the characteristic of a long gastralia. The Temnospondyli as a whole are divided into two orders. The long-extinct order Euspondyli contains a limited number of groups that are primarily terrestrial, including the Brachyop",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius.

He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, including the \" vulgar \" styles so despised by the literati. He was the first to use colloquialisms in his poetry, and his poem on \" The Passing of Childhood \" is one of the earliest examples of a poet expressing a personal experience. He was also one of the first to write poetry about his home ground, and his poems record in exquisite detail the many sights of life in the heart of China, from the busy streets of Chengdu to the desolate beauty of the mountains.
