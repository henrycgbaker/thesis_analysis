  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these major groups were independently reduced. Because of its similar position and its origin in the actinopterygian, the ear of tuataras is likely homologous with that of the amphibians, but needs to be confirmed through an osteology examination. Aquatic salamanders, as well as the lobe @-@ finned fish, also may have had a stapes, but they are currently unknown. Do any animals other than vertebrates have a stapes?\nA. No, this structure is unique to animals with backbones.\nB. Yes, all vertebrates have stapes.\nC. None of the above",
  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

Hitler had just been published\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The key phrases are as follows :\n\nScriptures: Topics: We use the answer \"C\" because the Hitler biography mentioned that his book was a collection of popular speeches.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to take part in the Crimean War, but were used to bomb Ottoman shore fortifications in the Baltic Sea, at Cronstadt during the Crimean War in 1855, and then at N\u00f6rdlingen on the Danube in 1856.\n La Marne and Reuter were tried for breaching the neutrality of Algiers in the Algiers action of 1856 where they shelled an Ottoman squadron, and of the Ottoman defenses of Hammam Lif in 1857 and were pressed into service for a short time as floating fortresses. Following the French victory at Solferino and San Martino, they formed",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Ordovician. All edopoidean taxa have an elongated, tapering, conical tooth crown. Edopoidea has been informally called the lambeosaurin assemblage because of the resemblances between Edops and Lambeosaurini. Edopoidea may be paraphyletic. As currently defined, the superfamily includes Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. The family has six genera and 39 species with a distribution from the Paleozoic to the Late Mesozoic. Cochleosaurida is enigmatic and its phylogenetic relationships are unsettled. The family is sometimes acknowledged as",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not nearly as clear - cut as was formerly thought. What might be concluded about the narrator after this?.\n A. They are an ill - educated fan of reptiles.\n B. They are a dinosaur lover.\n C. None of the above choices.\n D.

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour.

The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 5 anti - aircraft guns were added. The turreted gun director, originally placed next to a 40 mm automated gun mount, was gotten rid of. Above the bridge was fitted a Type 89 aerial spotting radar.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it?

Now add a small amount of washing oil to the water. Even though water and oil are not normally mixed very well, the oil will float on top of the water.

He laughs at such memories as a boy, just a little sheet of cloth sticking out of an old crate and eagerly strapping on a harness, climbing into the airplane feverishly and flying. \"There was never any back-exiting moments from that airplane,\" he concluded. Kerudd took off in a P-40, a model before his day, performing loops, spins and aerial stunts. Swearing his pilot's license at 17, he couldn't fly until he was 21 due to the age limit, he lied",

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as a witness protection officer, who was forced to keep his services secret from the Jewish community, who only know him as a successful lawyer who moved to distant Palermo. Rosenfeld noted The Portage as being one of the first experiments with \u201c convergent narration \u201d \u2014 resembling the stories of W. G.
