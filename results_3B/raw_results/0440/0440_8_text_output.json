On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units followed, and over the next few months they fought their way on in North Korea, closing the distance on the Xi n Amphibian Landing Area. The North Koreans surrendered these units with hardly a fight, and quickly the US forces were in position to reopen a supply route north.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until the following early summer, contenting themselves with the simple life of the countryside. What time period did Du Fu die in?\nA. He died during the Tang dynasty.\nB. He died during the Shang dynasty.\nC. He died during the Han dynasty.\nD. He died during the Qin dynasty.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Du Fu died in the year 763, during the Tang dynasty. There is a brief description of Du Fu's death, tentatively dateing from mid to late 763, in the poetry he wrote before this time. This explains that just before Du Fu died, his wife died.",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why was he due financial trouble?\nA. He wrote a depressing poem.\nB. He had no work.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. He despaired of his financial future.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Poetry has been one of the world\u2019s great vehicles for artistic expression since ancient times.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was mostly obsolete, at the Battle of the Yalu River in August 1894 and at the battles of the Yellow Sea in September.\nIn response to the vulnerability of the Meiji Navy's steel -clad armored warships in the Battle of Tsushima, the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered 5 modified versions of the obsolete lozenge - plate protected warships, as well as a dozen more. After the Russo - Japanese War, Japan commissioned 6 battleships as early as, and ordered 15 more in the following years. It was one of the first modern navies to operate the Dreadnought - Class battleships",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the release of the album, it's been no secret that Siliq was inspired by the modern antithesis of her musical journey with Keshi, TKXV and Johnny Point Blank (as \u201cSlimme Kvark\u201d). She follows her own path and drifts through the sixteen tracks with an eclectic mix of sounds. The result is the album Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke, which, musically and narratively, is much less EDM, hip-hop or trap oriented and much more concerning the pop and R&B genres but, in some cases, is also already at the brink of drone and any other paranormal genre",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Permian. Balanced by the absence of the following additional losses in the Edopoidea, and their inclusion in these group as they are the only extinct taxa in the group: the lack of an intratemporal bone (bone that runs between the temporal and jugal), the absence of a lacrimal, and the presence of the frontal being larger and a distinct bone. The most basal edopoidean, which also shows this larger frontal bone, is probably Bullockia. Bullockia was a rather small and broadly based amphibian, which was about 10-15 cm long. It had a broad head with a",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous amphibians is related more to their body proportions than to their vertebrae, so it is difficult even to discuss a stereospondyls vs. rhachitomi classification. Specifically, a nontriassic stereospondyl character that must be used is the presence of long posttemporal bones, which help distinguish it from all rhachitomous amphibians. Some groups are newly classified, but still, such as Branchiosauridae and Stereospondyli, an interpretation of what must be a arboreal life style is proposed. The manuscript has not yet been published. Is the template telling me that I",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, disrupting the American defensive operations by mine laying and the dropping of land mines. Then forward scouts would disappear into foxholes for a while, before reappearing, each time more boldly, to peer around the landscape from the known enemy positions. It seems clear that a sudden overwhelming attack, already planned and timed if necessary to coincide with the climax of the Rocket War when the Americans would be at their weakest anticipation, could become imminent any moment. Mortar fire, mainly aimed at the American ammunition dump, increased steadily through the afternoon and stopped only when darkness fell. Then came bursts of artillery nearer the field. They were probably not North",

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, both popular and erudite. The spirit of Du Fu's poetry is characterized by a literary technique appropriate to heroic poetry, the ability to blend reflection and action, and to master the poetry of chastisement, mourning and ecstasy.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words to describe the beauty of love, we can always come up with words of our own. Is expressing one\u2019s love a lowly or a lofty task?
