  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the Crimean War for effective use, but were employed by the British naval forces during the British occupation of Abyssinia in 1868. The design of these early iron warships was not revolutionary : they were a development of the pre - iron wooden naval vessel using steel armour and, in the case of the 1855 armoured ironclads, the addition of a copper sheathing to act as a double bottom to protect the hull from the effects of mines..

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was building strength against the Manchus. The successful Battle of Yalu River in 1894 was credited by the IJN to ironclad ships which had a decisive effect over the unarmored Chinese fleet. Thereafter the IJN worked to develop armored ships for eventual combat with America. Ironclads played a significant role in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, sinking three Russian armored cruisers in the Battle of Port Arthur, winning the Battle of the Yellow Sea, and the Battle of Tsushima.

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Lower Carboniferous ; therefore, temnospondyls appear to have existed by the Early Carboniferous. Edopoids can be divided into three subgroups. The most basal group is the family Edopidae, containing only one member, the genus Edops, with Edops tenuis known from three very incomplete skeletons. The following family, Cochleosauridae, contains a species from South Africa and Australia in the genus Cochleosaurus, plus two species from China in the genus Keralotionymosaurus.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous groups is not well defined. Why might the statement that this way of classifying temnospondyls is no longer viable be the case?\nA.
