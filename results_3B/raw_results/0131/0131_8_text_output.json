  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is of questionable value. So, as with other amniotes, the only distinction between stereospondyls and rhachitomous temnospondyls is in the structure of the vertebrae. So the \" Rachitomi \" have now been discarded. So what is the author of this passage probably referring to when he writes \" This classification is no longer viable \"?\nA. The classification system is now out of date.\nB.

  "How does the Most Accurate Estimate compare to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Total System's earnings prospects, and what impact could this have on the stock's near-term price?\nGenerate according to: Total System Services (TSS - Free Report)\tis expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.1%.\nRevenues are expected to be $993.11 million, up 12.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Total System?\nFor Total System, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.04%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Total System will beat the consensus EPS estimate",
