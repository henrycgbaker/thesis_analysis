  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n In the year 726, Emperor Zhangzong ( Emperor Ruizong ), then ruling the Tang dynasty, moved the capital from Luoyang to Chang 'an ; this led Emperor Wuzong, who would succeed to the throne in 841, to write a poem describing Chang 'an as he had left it, \" A great city with tall walls, with many palaces of yellow brick and white marble.\" \n Du Fu was said to have grown up in his maternal uncle's house. \n According to the Siku quanshu, he was married on his 20th birthday, as recorded in the poem ( see left",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used. When their commander, Commodore Richard Dundas, discovered that the war was over, instead of returning to England or going home, to the embarrassment of his commander - in-chief, they continued cruising at the head of the fleet until they came upon several French vessels of war, against whose gunboats Dundas was prepared to do battle.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 onwards, and then returned to Chang'an. At this time, in about 765, Du Fu was asked to prepare to compile his poetry and his prose for publication. What city was Du Fu and his family in after returning to Changan?\nA. Chongqing\nB. Xichang\nC. Beijing\nD. Chang'an\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: After Du Fu left Luoyang in 759, Du Fu and his family continued to travel until they returned to Chang'an in China.

  "Vikram and Shankar\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 has been postponed many times so far and it looks like the delays are not going to end anytime soon for this Shankar movie. The movie is getting ready in post-production process but there are a lot of delays and issues that must be overcome before it can hit the theatres.\nTamil film sources say that at least another 6 \u2013 7 weeks of work is left for the movie but there is no official response from the team. Meanwhile, the VFX and CG team is working flat out to meet the expectations of Shankar. Vikram and Amy Jackson will be seen as the principal leads in the much delayed project. Amy Jackson had a few issues but she has recovered now. The team has roped in the likes of Mani Ratnam and A R Rahman among other top notch crew for providing their inputs to the movie. Now there\u2019s a need for the movie to have a release and they need all the time to do this.\nThere were initial plans to release it on Deepavali but then it was postponed for better output in post-production process.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What may have been the reason for Du Fu's \" peaceful period \"?\nA. He was a poet.\nB. He was a musician.\nC. He was a politician.\nD. He was a musician.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: If you are going to succeed at something for the long run, it helps to have passion for that endeavor. The great poets tend to have a lot of passion for their craft, so we might expect them to have \" one of the happiest and most peaceful periods \" or time in their lives related in some way to their work. That makes sense. Poet Du Fu is an example,",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which threatened Japan's control of Korea and Manchuria in September 1874 during the Battle of Yalu River.\nBy 1895, Japan had a 6,100 ton armoured turret and was one of the world's most formidable fighting navy and the first to use submarines. They commissioned the ironclad Kong\u014d in 1905, the largest armored cruiser ever built in the world during its 21, 400 ton displacement period ( the first battleships had a displacement ranging between 16, 200 to 22, 000 ton and the 22, 400 - 25, 000 ton ).\n",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous, and the youngest, Psephorex pachecoae, only died out 65 million years ago. It became the sister group to the superorder Lysorophia.\n The second most basal group among temnospondyls is the superorder Stereospondyli. Stereospondyls have several derived features, including a large occipital condyle with many foramina that may have held blood vessels to the brain and a long, narrow body. Stereospondyls have a few extant descendants, such as the frogs. The most primitive Stereosponyli is the",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous condition appears to be the result of convergence rather than evolutionary change. The vertebrae of a broad array of temnospondyll species are now considered to be stereospondylous in nature, and the suborder Stereospondyli is no longer a useful concept. The suborder Stereospondyli had previously included all of the major groups of stem- Temnospondyli, including the well - known genus Eryops ( pictured below ), and it seemed obvious that this suborder needed a replacement. What would be a suitable replacement of stereospindyli sub - order?\nA. The",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can do to make decisions we can live with. Right Between Your Ears is based on the book of the same title written with Dr. Dan Freeman and published by Princeton University Press, and explores both how to avoid being convinced that the world is ending and what to do for yourself in the eventuality that your certainty is indeed mistaken and that your beliefs are wrong. Dr. Freeman was one of the leading proponents of the movement of people who expected the world will end in 2011, and who turned to him with questions related to the issue. This documentary provides a unique peek into their experiences.\nRight Between Your Ears is a fascinating",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \".

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words of the old masters, many of the classic lines below will make a great starting point for your next attempt to write a love song. Love is what we need to find our happiness! You need someone you like or you need him to make you feel good and happy, right? But that person might not be a good fit, and your feelings for him might not be reciprocated. Maybe he\u2019s only after your body. If he loves you, then he wants you to be happy and he\u2019s willing to work hard to make you happy. And the thing is that we all want someone who cares about us. So, if he",

He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as mediator for the Jewish victims of war. The New York Times Book Review called it both \" a powerful and beautiful novel \" that \" has the force of a poem \". The novel's \" evocation of the South American landscape is remarkable and the author has succeeded in writing with an authenticity that is at a high imaginative and descriptive level, not to mention his ability to convey such depth and breadth of feelings to his readers \".
