The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Crimean War.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which ravaged Manchuria during the Sino-Japanese War. In a powerful 1894\u201395 engagement on the Yalu River, the older Chinese steamers were driven back into the shallow water of Korea's west coast and destroyed, though the Japanese lost three ships and 350 officers and men. Later on, the British Ironclad, HMS Cumberland, was sunk and she became the first warship sunk at sea by a foreign power, with a large loss of Japanese lives.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls becomes impossible once the molecule biology studies are taken into account. These studies show that despite the greater complexity of the rhachitomous cranial and jaw carry mechanisms, the two conditions are identical as far as their genetic material is concerned. This is not true between stereophlous traits. Genetically, the two conditions could be represented by extremes of alkalinity in a single family of basaglians that is so dimorphic that small changes anywhere in the molecule could convert one type ried to another. What system is the narrator talking about?\nA. The bass system.\nB. The molecule system.\n",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we are able to understand about the human mind. At the end of the film, director Eric Rothmann makes recommendations for parents, teachers, politicians and those who care about building constructive institutions of altruism and free thinking. Message: Truth is found in disagreements, debate and dialogue. Different opinions help us develop more nuanced ideas and ultimately, a more sophisticated grasp of truth.

  "Could you perform an experiment for me using a jar of water and food coloring to demonstrate the immiscibility of liquids?\nGenerate according to: After a rainstorm have you ever noticed puddles in the road with glossy-looking oil floating on top? Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in the center. Look for a wavy surface to the water and observe if the water is completely clear to see if the food coloring mixed in. Food coloring floats on top. This only occurs because of the hydrophobic or water-hating qualities of oil.\nOne way to see you may consider using dye to demonstrate non-miscibility. Dyes are soluble in water but not incompletely soluble in water. Make a blue colored water (yes, you can do this in a vial of water by adding blue food coloring). Then pour a droplet of whiskey/brandy on to the floor without wearing gloves. Watch",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words ourselves, we are lucky because we have distributors of the modern age who are qualified to perform the tasks of distributing our love words.\nOpinions are distinct and imaginative, but the emotions flourish when there comes a momentous meeting between two souls. When that happens, many things materialize, and they can be related to. They are related to love and can be expressed as love. Similar to the way painters sweetly sketch on their canvases the images taken from their hearts, romantic poets bring to life feelings in words. That's when they turn on to pen and turn to paper. And they say they pour out their hearts. They sit",
