Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nIn 719, when he was three, his family was transferred to Kaifeng county, Henan province. In 720, the government relocated the imperial court to Chang 'an, so the family moved there to serve Liu Cong, a prominent general in the court who was made the provincial governor of Henan. In 724, however, Liu Cong was dismissed from office over a rebellion, and the family moved back to Henan. \nDu Fu started his formal education at the age of 13 or 14 in Kaifeng.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War, but were used against the fortifications at Genoa in 1859. They were then used by the Italians in the expedition against Naples (1860). The British Mameluke also saw service in the war, although she was not a true floating battery as she was too high in the water.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was modernizing its fleet to challenge the IJN's domination of East Asia. The IJN was able to defend against the Beiyang fleet at the Battle of the Yalu River in September 1894, although the IJN did not engage the Beiyang fleet in combat. The Imperial Japanese Navy was decisively defeated in the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, when it attempted to intercept the Russian Baltic Fleet, which turned and destroyed the Japanese fleet at Tsushima in the first major fleet-to-fleet engagement of the Russo-Japanese War.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is as arbitrary as the distinction between rachitomi and stereospondyli. The bulk of living and extinct temnospondyls have a relatively simple vertebrae ; those that have complex vertebrae are either primitive forms that have outlived their group, or are in one or more close relationships with the more primitive forms. What may be the reason the author has a problem classifying temnospondyls?\nA. They are very complex.\nB. They have rhachitomous vertebrae.\nC. They have stereospondyli vertebrae.\nD",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.
