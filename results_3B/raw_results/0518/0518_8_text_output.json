The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was attempting to blockade the Japanese ports in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). After the war, the IJN built a number of large armored cruisers and battleships, including the world's first battleship with a double turret, the Mikasa ( \u4e09\u7b20 ).

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous.  It is one of the most primitive temnospondyls, having features in common with both edopooids and anthracosaurids. Balanerpeton is the type genus of the family Balanerpetontidae.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial, since the stereospondylous condition is the primitive one. What may be the reason for the classification of temnospondyls?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. The complex vertebrae are not primitive.\nC.

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, why we believe it, and how we come to believe it.\nThe author of The Social Animal, a New York Times bestseller, has written a provocative, entertaining, and illuminating exploration of the mysteries of the human mind. In this book, David Brooks argues that the mind is composed of two different systems that interplay in typically unobtrusive ways. One is a rational, logical, number-crunching machine, concerned with proof, certainty, and objective reality. The other is a system of networks and relationships, nonverbal cues, and instincts, driven by emotion and consciousness. Brooks explores how we are all",
