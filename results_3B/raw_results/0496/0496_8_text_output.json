In context switching, the process switches to a different process by switching the entire working state of the process to a memory, as well as all registers and other important process information. However, the new process is stored in the same memory. When the process changes to another process, it is called context switching.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units overtook the North Korean defenders during the September 19 \u2013 21. What will happen to the invading North Korean army?\nA. They will have to stay in Korea to be used as hostages\nB.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been sent by Empress Dowager Cixi to negotiate the opening of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ended the First Sino-Japanese War. In the Second Sino-Japanese War the IJN sent its cruisers to the east China coast and fought the Chinese fleet near Shanghai in August 1937.\nBattles and conflicts\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy fought in a variety of battles and conflicts.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. The genus Edops existed throughout the Carboniferous ( Late Mississippian - Early Pennsylvanian ), including two more recent species, both from North America : Edops marginatus (represented by three specimens from Kentucky and Illinois ) and E. fairchildi (represented by a single specimen from Kentucky). Edops has been placed in Edopoidea, although an analysis by Healy (1998) has suggested that the group is paraphyletic with respect to Cochleosauridae. Healy placed E. marginatus and E. fairchildi in Euparkeriidae, and some have",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms, while biologically valid, is not a hard and fast rule. The discovery of a number of large rhachitomous forms, including the early Permian Rhynchosauroidea ( if correctly classified ) and the Middle Triassic Eryopidae, means that only 8 suborders of temnospondyls are now recognised : Dissorophoidea, Leptopleurodonidea, Stereospondyli, and Eryopidae, for the rhachitomous forms ; and Capitosauria, Brachyopidae, Trematosauria, and Mastodonsauridae",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can write down our emotions. This is what makes love poems so personal. It does not take much to express the feelings we have for someone special.\nA poem does not necessarily have to be composed with the words of another person. Just imagine how you would feel if the person you were in love with wrote to you and told you how he feels about you. Would it not be lovely? The same can be said for love poems. If you truly loved a particular person, you would want to be able to show your love and affection in words.\nOne way to express your love for someone is to write a love poem. A",

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.8%.\nRevenues are expected to be $830.54 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Total System?\nFor Total System, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects.
