  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late at Kinburn to be used, but were later used successfully against Russian land defences, in particular in the Crimean War historic Battle of Bomarsund in the \u00c5land Islands in 1854 during the Anglo-Swedish War. The original British floating battery had been Boney, but she was too small to berth for repairs at the Westersande Slipways in Madeira Island ( Portugal ) in 1855. After repairs she was renamed Repulse and returned to service. The modified sea-going boiler had not worked well and due to the violent motions of the iron-clad in sea surges, particularly off Madagascar,",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units occupied the abandoned positions from the northeast and forced the North Koreans westward to the Naktong and Nansung rivers. Why would the UN units begin advancing out of their defensive positions?\nA. They were reaching the end of the Pusan Perimeter.\nB. They were pushing forward.\nC. They were occupying abandoned positions.\nD. They were fleeing in panic.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The South Korea and United Nations forces occupied the position abandoned by their fleeing enemies.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766 until spring 768. Xia Jinyu and his elder sons arrived in the capital the previous autumn, and Du Fu's older daughter became pregnant during the time he spent in the city. In recognition of his former valor, Du Fu's position and his prospects had improved considerably. It was agreed that Du Fu's younger son should become a civil high - rank official soon after he had attained adulthood.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been assisted by British experts and ships during the First Sino-Japanese War and then had sent the first Japanese humidors abroad for allied consultations in the Russo-Japanese War. The opportunity was seized by Russia to capture the island of Sakhalin. The IJN fended off the ill-fated Japanese attempt at the Northern most Jutlandic Sound in South-East Asia. Fighting continued on land between the Japanese Navy and the Imperial Russian Navy during which the Russian ships easily captured Peiping in 1904, where Qing troops, under General Rovolova, full of Imperial Russian anti-Japanese bitterness, love for down-t",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondalous taxa is not reliable, and different authors have adopted differing criteria. What may be the reason for the answer choices being chosen as untrue?\nA. None of the answers are right but it sounds better than the answer I know is true.\nB.
