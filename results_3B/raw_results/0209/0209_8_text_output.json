Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was equipped with light warships, especially paddle steamers modified into armed gunboats. Paddle steamers were cheaply converted and slow moving, but were able to make large thick armor un economical. The first Empire of Japan used warships primarily for battling against pirates and naval skirmishes in the early days and thus the Japanese side of the Naval Battle of Nagasaki during the Shimoda\u2013Honshu\u2013Tosa War of 1855 \u2013 56 in was won by the IJN's ironclad eiko leaving 700 ton warship the Iebashi ( \u8239\u6a4b ship bridge ).

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is based on the similarity between the vertebrae and Amniotes. These concepts are discussed more fully in Hoffman ( 1994 ).

Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, what we really hold true, and what's lost when we make the fatal mistake of believing something is absolute.
