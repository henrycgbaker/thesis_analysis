Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous. The most primitive edopoidea is Edops, which has several primitive characteristics, including the following : * A single occipital condyle * A bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls * An absence of an occipital flange, which is a small bone that is present in other temnospondyls. * No evidence for any kind of temporal fenestra * A relatively small number of teeth * A large number of small vertebrae.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms, based on differences in the number of vertebrae, is no longer tenable. The stereospondyls are now considered a paraphyletic assemblage. Why did the speaker use the term \"paradigm\"?\nA. They wanted to describe a pattern.\nB. They wanted to describe a theory.\nC.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, only to be killed by fire. What may be the reason that the US is having problems?\nA. They do not have enough supplies.\nB. They do not communicate with each other well.\nC. They do not have enough ammunition.\nD.
