  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling?

This instruction saves the state of the current process, including its registers, stack, and other relevant information, and restores the state of the next process to be executed. The context switch instruction is typically implemented as a system call, which allows the operating system to save and restore the context of a process without interrupt",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli.
