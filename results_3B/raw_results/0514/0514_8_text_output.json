The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had taken refuge in the Yangtze River delta and defeated the Qing Dynasty in the First Sino-Japanese War. These victories were followed by the Russo-Japanese War, which ended with Japan's victory and the collapse of the Russian Empire, igniting a surge of imperialism in Asia. In the Russo-Japanese War, the battleship, a new class of warship, played an important role. The Imperial Navy was composed of 50 battleships and 76 cruisers, far exceeding the 20 battleships and 23 cruisers of its rivals. Battleship battles, such as Tsushima in 1905, were decisive",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the pups are now living in a pack, they have to learn to live together. They have different personalities, different temperaments and different ways to express themselves. It is not always easy to understand each other or to recognize who has a good intention and who does not. But they are still not old enough to live independently. For the first time, the pack is brought together at the age of four rather than three years. This makes it more difficult to integrate.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous, but Dendrerpeton gracilis and D. priscum have been found in the Early Permian. Cochleosaurids are also widely found in the Late Carboniferous. Edopoidea is sometimes defined as the clade containing Edops, Cochleosaurus and all temnospondyls more closely related to Edops than to Cochleosaurus. Edopoidea is also sometimes defined as including the families Cochleosauridae, Nyctiphanidae, Dendrerpetontidae and Edopidae, but it is unclear whether these taxa are a monophyletic group",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms appears to have gone through periods of reversal within each group. What aspect of the vertebrates will be discussed?\nA.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and tried to take prisoners or steal weapons and food.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as \" saviour \" and \" anti-hero \", as well as by the novel's \" brilliant \" way of capturing the American dreams and nightmares of the 1960s. Rosenfeld argued that The Portage was a book that, in its treatment of the \" complex forces that shape the American experience \", was capable of changing the way people perceived their nation.
