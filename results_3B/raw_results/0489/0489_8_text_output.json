Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry \" 5 to 9 days coal \", and the situation was similar with the early ironclads. Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle ), and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level. \nSails served several practical functions. With 75 ft of sail area, it was difficult to maneuver the ship with the steam engine only ; running up the sails at half mast helped the ship round without the need for complex steering. When Warrior was steaming under steam, her sails could be used to carry an additional supply of water ( under sail the ship carried only 28 cu yd water, less than the coal bunkers and steam plant ).

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units, especially the 1st Marine Division, who had supplied the most fighting, moved rapidly out of the perimeter, as did the British Commonwealth forces. What may be the reason for the withdrawal?\nA. There were no more lines left to defend.\nB. They wanted to enter the perimeter.\nC. They wanted to attack the North Koreans.\nD.

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to winter 766.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why has this poet had so many issues with his finances?\nA. He is self - absorbed and does not save money.\nB. He wastes money.\nC. He is obsessed with his art and forgoes all other things.\nD.

That is, unless they run short, like the poet in this story. As the story begins, the poet is worried about his finances. He believes that Yan Wu, a friend, will help him out.",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had come to Korea to protect Qing dynasty interests from Japanese encroachment. The IJN warship Satsuki (last ship to bear that name in the IJN) was sunk by the Beiyang ship Huguang ( \u6d2a\u6b66 ) in 1894. As late as 1904, the Japanese faced down a formidable Russian naval presence in the Battle of Tsushima. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, her remaining ironclads and cruisers had already been converted to aircraft carriers. In 1862, Admiral Montrond laid the keel of one of the first ironclads",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Pennsylvanian. Edopoids live in fresh water environments and have evolved with a wide range of body forms, from small brachyopid-like forms to large and long-bodied trialestes.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not absolute. The stereospondylous form was first thought to be more derived, and so one could predict that stereospondylous forms would be earlier and more primitive, but the presence of stereospondylous forms in the Triassic and the presence of rhachitomous forms in the Permian have shown that neither condition is primitive. [1] The bones of most animals are formed of several pieces, as in these four-dimensional bone models. [2] The bone development in reptiles has long been studied as a consequence of their economic and taxonomic significance. When comparing the different, more",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter while others mounted a nearby hill and continued to lob shells down on the foxhole of Spc.4 Cpl. Meade. Why are the North Koreans attacking?\nA. Because they are hungry.\nB. Because they are surrounded.\nC. Because they are afraid.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: In order to understand the way someone is feeling or thinking, we often look at what they are doing or what is happening to them.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, you can still speak about your lover in ways that are unique and soulful. It is much easier for people to break into song, if only to express their feelings. They find solace in expressing their hearts and souls to each other. Poets pour their feelings in order to inspire their lovers and they write poems as a direct expression of their emotion.
