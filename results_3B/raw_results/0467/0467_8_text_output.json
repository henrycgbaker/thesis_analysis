Use object-oriented programming principles to design your implementation.

Implementing a push method that inserts a new node should be relatively easy, provided you ensure the correct direction (from bottom to top) for all operations.

In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nIn the reign of Emperor Shen-zong ( Emperor of Tang ), Du Fu became an outstanding scholar but was passed over in favour of his elder brother ; the emperor then changed from his previous fondness for Du Fu to his younger brother.

  " The first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors, and these features were only gradually abandoned.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the Battle of Lissa that year to join that action, but they were subsequently employed on many other occasions. This time, they would not only face the threat of being attacked by other iron-clads but had to face their own in battle, for on the night of September 16, 1905, Glatton engaged with a torpedo battery ( the Russian armoured ship Peresvet ). This was during that year's Battle of Port Arthur and Glatton sank in the melee.

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until the summer of 767 when the last member of his family ( a little grandson ) and his youngest son ( a daughter ) died suddenly, either of cholera or from the plague and/or from starvation during the long journey downstream. As he had predicted in'Song of Everlasting Sorrow'earlier in his exile : \" If you wish, go far. The mountains are the same.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. This year what happened?\n A. Poets died of sickness\n B. poets died a natural death\n C. poets passed away\n D. poets died from sickness\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: If people die in December or January, then the winter might be cold; if they die from sickness in the spring when the weather is better, this might be unlucky. The poem 'A Winter Solstice Odes' by Li Bai was inspired by the deaths of two poets in the same year. However these were unusual circumstances where bad luck was involved. Usually people died a fairly normal death in any part of the year. The poet Li",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was being sent in a show of force by the Treaty of Shimonoseki against Korea. The IJN was also sent two large armored cruisers to participate in a joint operation by the major imperial European navies as part of the China Relief Expedition. The first of these, Kong\u014d (later renamed Tosa ), commanded the main group of vessels which fought off the Chinese Beiyang fleet.\nThe Treaty ended an era of dominance by the Western European navies on the global stage.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Middle-Late Devonian. Although many species are known and new species continue to appear, most edopoids appear to have had small size ranging between 12 and 45 centimeters (4.7 and 18 inches) in length. Edopid skulls usually exhibit a small rostrum, often with the maxilla or the postorbital bar fusing to the occipital, an angular fontanel present behind the orbit. The nasal, a pair of parietals, the quadrates and squamosals are connected by a large jugal. Cochleosaurids, on the other hand, appear to have larger",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has become problematical, and is no longer recognized by most zoologists. A group with a basic rhachitomous structure ( i.e., a simple vertebra with the central cavity, not segmented ), can also evolve complex vertebrae and, consequently, be assigned to Rachitosyndi but with a secondary derivation in the Rhineidae, Stereozygii. In this manner a number of subgroups can be proposed. Why would the author consider this change?\nA. To better reflect the current phylogenetics.\nB. In the hope that these temnospondyles can become extinct.\nC.",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we might mean by the certainty that fuels human behaviour. As we watch people in these stories, it becomes clear that beliefs become convictions not by logical reasoning but, rather, from an instinct to fit ourselves into a narrative. When these beliefs are challenged through doubt, people often experience emotional pain as they face a conflict between themselves and their beliefs. This conflict leads to defensiveness and anger and a desire to defend a person\u2019s beliefs with anything and everything - and often, anything goes! The truth? We are all, to some extent flawed when we have strong beliefs. The good news? Our ability to believe what feels good about us also leads",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the foxhole, and when the defenders moved to drive them back and fired, the Chinese who were behind them were not repelled.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from everyday speech to that of literary masters and to the poetic prose of Wang Zhi. Du Fu is the first poet whose work, however different, was accepted equally by all regions and all literary genres, a fact for which Yuan Zhen also praises him. In 805, Du Fu, now in poor health, left Chang 'an and moved to Chengdu. It was his last stay in a place he greatly enjoyed and in which many of his best-known poems were written. He died on June 8, 70 days after leaving the Han capital. Du Fu never became fully established at court, however. His lack on good",

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets.

Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we, of course, cannot deny the romantic appeal of love poems.\nLove is a mystery that is a complex mixture of all sorts. From the very young heart that first knows love, to the adult\u2019s more experienced passion. In love we have hope for romance, for adventure, and even for a lifelong relationship with some other human, if all goes well. And in love there are many challenges, many lessons, some happy and others not so happy!
