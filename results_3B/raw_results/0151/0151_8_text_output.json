Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n Du Fu liked to note details that were less evident to most observers : In The Poet Who Flew the Kites with his Son and To Lay Flowers on the Stone of the Acrobat Poet, he mentioned that a set of white butterflies landed on the sky wall to eat pollen, and between them on the ground he found a thread of dew on an I-blossom.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units advanced rapidly, following behind their retreating foe.\nOne battalion is lost, \u201c half - killed \u201d at Masan, at least, where US Navy shore bombardment is said to have been as effective as that on Okinawa, but MacArthur also wins the Inchon landings which his soldiers might never have anticipate d, for all that he had been forced to delay them, blocked by the Japanese Navy.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765, thus cutting short the plan to visit Luoyang in autumn 766.#@-@@ although he was determined not to go back to live on that land the government had hoped he might return to, in one of the few sallies of happiness during their years in exile, Du Fu wrote a poem about its beauty :#@# The stream meanders westward, once triumphant then calm ;\n     the altars proud are stoic.#@-@  What moved him so was Wu Zetian's relocation of the new capital to Danyang ( near todays Yang Cheng ), a historical emper",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What may one conclude about Du Fu's life if he was impoverished?\nA. He was poor but remained humble.\nB. He was constantly in financial trouble.\nC. He lacked support from his coworkers.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Poverty can affect anyone. People who are poor do not always talk about their situation  and some in fact are very happy about it. Du Fu may be underlying that his situation may have been worsened but he had learned to be happy even in his circumstances. Du Fu was not poor, but because of his temperament he enjoyed giving lavish presents to family and friends",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which later became the Republic of China ( ROC )\u6d77\u8ecd Navy, and then the Russian forces that invaded the island in the late nineteenth century, often causing the deaths of Chinese and Russian sailors that mutinous crews aboard the Japanese ships believed sold out the country's honor to foreigners.\n1 First Ironclad: Kavachi\n3 Azuma (built 1888)\n4 Legg & Maudslay\nFirst Ironclad: Kavachi\nBuilt in 1884, the first LKM1-class Mikasa-five -pounder ironclad Kavachi ( Japanese\u6cb9\u6226\u8266 \u66f3\u6a4b ) was a tribute",

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous taxa became blurred with the discovery of a number of well - differentiated stereospondyl lines among the rhachitomous forms. Temnospondyls are traditionally placed in Actinaria, though their close relationships are uncertain. What group do they belong to?\nA. Rhaetotrites\nB. Amphibians\nC. Reptiles\nD.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we as humans believe not only about what is happening in the world, but about our own identity, about our fleest and most precious convictions, and our capacity for courage.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and engaged in horrific hand - to - hand combat.
