  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units changed their advance to a chase rather than an advance and moved toward Seoul, driving all the way to the outskirts of the city as other UN forces flew on to Inchon ( Koreans call the city Namyeong ) by air. The Chinese made a number of probing strikes with small - scale missile and artillery exchanges in attempts to pluck out the UN forces south of the Kim South Korea still surprised Pentagon by resistance along southern coast against US forces intent on taking Seoul as trapping N.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to late spring 767. This was not a place known for religious people or beauty, but was it where Du Fu seemed to find a home? It was not far from the Yangtze, long a characteristic of his years in bora ( see exercise 21, b ), as was Kaiping in Hebei.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. After ransoming himself, returning to Sichuan in 764, Du Fried finally emerged from his financial troubles, possibly encouraged by the patronage of the influential Yuan Yanzhang, and composed two of his finest works, the wu fu long poems \" Mr. Ye as Caretaker of the Pearl River House \" and \" Restoring the Fertile Field \"..

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which, following the Analogue period (China\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u56fd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u571f\u6728\u79d1\u4e3e bundan Buy\u014d ), had become the professional navy of China under the Qing Dynasty.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Middle Permian (the Capitanian St Whale petrified Forest National Monument rock bed.), and diversiforsainur Marsh Lhegwele was previously thought to be remarkably similar to several other stereospondyls. However, a recent study has established it as a basal edopoidean because of differences in some of the skeletal structure. While Dendrerpetontidae, Cochleosauridae and Edops are restricted to North America, representatives of Piplestidae are found across the Western Hemisphere (including modern-day North, South and Central America, Europe and Asia ).

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not strictly objective. Where do temnospondyls have their traditional identification class?\nA. Physics\nB. Geology\nC. None of the above choices.\nD.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can use some lines to swirl around our heads as we experience life and love before transferring our feelings onto the page. Romantic poetry is known for its unforgettable thoughts and heart-melting lines that begs to be recited aloud. Some are innocent, exhilarating, introspective, short, and long. The essence, however, is the same.
