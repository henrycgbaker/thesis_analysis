  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling?\u00a0\nIn course 100 of OCLS, we talked about context switching. Any process that allocates object-oriented language syntax data structures gets context switched. On Linux, context switching does not mean reallocating or object-creating. Thread context switching involves creating a new stack frame to switch threads. Context switching refers to application layout including memory allocation and use, and garbage collection. Thread switching can be viewed as using C++ for scheduling.\nThread context switching is also performed to coordinate and synchronize multiprocessor platforms, but context switching is more common for prior art. In the Linux operating system context switching can also be called process switching if a new process",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.

The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which defended the opening of the Shandong Peninsula in 1894. The subsequent First Sino-Japanese Warterminated the decade-long Treaty to Cede China\u2019s islands to Imperial Japan and gave the IJN access to the waters of the China Sea, in addition to the Tsushima Strait. The new-found superiority on the water earned the IJN the results of the Russo-Japanese War, and its victory at the Battle of Tsushima the Japanese right to rise as \"one of the great strides of Eurasia,\" according to W.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Permian. The oldest known edopoid nonetheless is Trochocephalus greenwoodi. Edopoids were early diverging land vertebrates, diverging from the great chain of temnospondyls over 280 million years ago. Another diverse and successful family, the Rhythids, also shows up within the Edopoidea.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is still used in many modern discussions of the group. How does the narrator describe the animosities?\nA.
