  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling? I am quite confused by that, sorry.\n\n!\n\nLinux processes take up system resources, and multiple processes share use of system resources (think of owning a computer). The operating system has to be able to keep tabs on all of these processes if these processes are to interact and communicate.\n\nHowever, context switching is the switching between processes when multiple processes are being executed. Implementing context switching is a lot like implementing a time switch. You have a bit or generator, which runs low power, and when a specific event happens, it triggers an interrupt. As a simple example, the event can be when a game finishes, and the generator is high",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pressed forward despite sporadic resistance from North Korean and Chinese infiltrators assailing their flanks. What destroyed the North Korean's supply and reinforcement routes?\nA.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until late spring 767. What may be a plausible reason why Du Fu traveled slowly to the possibilities of government forces in the area he was heading to?\nA. There were no transportation facilities \nB. There were changes in routes of the Yangtze River \nC. There was a curfew observed on the Yangtze River \nD. There was a change in political regimes \nAnswer: A\nExplanation:  This slower pace that he started traveling at after leaving Luoyang is perhaps when his eyesight got too bad for him to read any more.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Where did the narrator stay?\nA. They made Sichuan their home.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been modernized from scratch based on French designs. These ships had no trouble in sending a humiliating message to the Europeans through their victories over the Chinese fleet. They also supported Admiral Yi Sun-sin's successful attack against the Japanese heads, bringing to naught the project to annihilate Korea\u2019s monarchy. The IJN collided with the strengthening of the Russian Navy, but the IJN managed to outwit the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 using its Imperial Japanese Naval Reserve.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince \u201eDas Band der Flinte\u201c, the wolves have just shifted to their new territory. The journey from the old territory to this new one is very exciting for the pack. After more than two years they are in a different landscape: boulderstudded rock formations, multi-layered layer sequences, sand dunes and low-lying plains. Shima says that particularly the shifting of the landscape feels very different on the left and right sides of the border. Back in the canyon, Aragorn and Kaspar decide to teach the pups some tricks and to give them a few siblings-commandos to learn how to react to everything that happens around",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous or Early Permian. Later species of Dendrerpeton persisted into the Middle Late Triassic.     In spite of the fact that there are many usages of the name \"bastetids\", based on the common English translation of the Ancient Egyptian name for Bast, there is no scientific consensus on which group of Hylaini (and Howesia ) is the most basal. Some researchers include such genera as Nyctereutes, Rhytidosteus, Skoliosaurus, and unnamed early Triassic species like P. simsa and P. nielseni. Others which have been",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls was phylogenetically ambiguous - Rhinesuchus was perfectly quadrate and interocipital in structure, yet in several instances temnospondyl presacral vertebrae without associated body was bigger. Within stereospondyls, the distinction between Annacytotemnospondyli and other species was fundamental to the placement of the taxa. what did I witness at one time?\nA.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, visible with scopes, but we 'll discuss this aspect in our book briefly.
