  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate and Bomb Vengeur was available solely for demonstration purposes. The use of floating batteries differs from engaging in extended sailing, but their primary purpose in many cases is to supply maritime logistics of remote regions such as for river fluvial works.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units moved up to follow along the right flank giving South Korea first opportunity at liberating the South Korean city of Taeju. While a small force was overwhelmed and fled into the hills leaving supply caches and tons of ordinance and electronic items for destruction, they, trying to defend Taeju fell almost immediately.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which Captain Robert F.A. Elliott describe better than mere statistics. His description was told many years distance and in a somewhat mystical way but anyone present later under more controlled conditions might encounter similar reactions. These results included the defeat of second squadron of the Chinese warcraft that, itself might have gotten involved with escort vessels. Then efforts proceeded for a Chinese relief of Shanghai. It included imperial Chinese naval units and native Beiyang Navy and possibly Australian units were effected but the issue was whether Beiyang might cease its intention. Local military forces sometimes preceded the late coming Beiyang fleet by initiating an attack. The Chinese units sailed towards South Tangshan",
