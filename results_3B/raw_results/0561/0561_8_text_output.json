  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", not the real man. But the truth is that though Steiner's Hitler may not be the \" real man \" many students interpreted his speech in dramatic fashion. What may be the reason Hitler is approved by certain people?\nA. They have not read the text.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. They have studied the history.\nD.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used in the campaign. However they did see action in the American Civil War, starting in 1861 with demonstrated use against the Confederate rifled iron battering ram CSS Missouri, before taking part in the Battle of Hampton Roads and the Siege of Port Hudson. The unarmored British experimental land ironclad Royal Sovereign took part in the Crimean War, accompanied by the ironclad-built monitor Diadem. These would later be converted into cruiser - type first - line ironclads in order to transport troops.Common naval guns for use on these ships were :Early 1850's: 8\" Rod",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units were quickly able to split the withdraw into detachments, and each day more North Korean units would be captured or destroyed while retreating. The troops often abandoned a great deal of artillery, supplies, and other equipment. What does the above passage suggest about that given how they felt at an attempt to retake the Pusan Perimeter?\nA. Because the UN discovered them abandoning the area, they quickly fought to prevent them from getting into North Korea.\nB.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the late Carboniferous, and would have been in the same environment as Edops. Balanerpeton typically had four very large toes, rather than the three seen in Edops, and two smaller, hourglass-shaped flaps of skin. Edops is also characterised by having a single supraoccipital bone on its skull.\n Some species of the genus Edops resemble the dwarf dinosaurs of the British Pennsylvanian, and would appear capable of austere limb use.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is unclear. What secondary school discipline is the narrator presenting here?\nA. Biology\nB. Chemistry\nC.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but American fire drove them off, the US Marines averting what could have become a Waterloo. After noon and until the end of the battle, the US Marine perimeter was fully under North Korean control. Fire came from every direction, except from ahead. On the peak of the ridge, the white flag of truce fluttered in the wind. They came under artillery, mortar and rifle fire so strong that the voice of their mortuary officer could be heard, \"Turn and run\u00a0: turn and run, boys. \" The radio was out of spares.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, that does not mean we cannot express our love by writing them. In addition, it is comforting to know that the Romantic poems extend a hand to us, so we do not feel all alone. In this poem, the author parallels the human passion for pursuit with the more aggressive relationships humans can have with animals and the elements of nature. While Duffy\u2019s love for her dog is quite passionate, it is the outcome of her homosexual relationship that provides the most humor. Duffy equates the time their bodies passed together within the confines of her London flat with the movements of a Sudoku puzzle \u2013 a logical puzzle that needs to be solved. Inev",

  "A place that is so pious, so pure that no impurity can even enter the premises of the \u201cDham\u201d. Infact, it is a spiritual land. This is the place that Guru Maharaj Himself selected for performing the last rites for His Human Form a few months before leaving it. As per His instructions, His Samadhi is built at this very place. Such is the power of the place that anyone who comes with a pure heart and a belief in Gurudev is cured of all problems. Many people have experienced His physical presence at His Samadhi. At the Neelkanth Dham there are two large buildings. One has the Samadhi of Gurudev and Guru Amar Das\u2019 samadhi.
