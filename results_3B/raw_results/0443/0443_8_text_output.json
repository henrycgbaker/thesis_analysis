  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War, but were present at the Second Battle of Kinburn in May 1855. What was probably the cause of the boats used at the Battle of Kinburn? Starting a war is a good cause, but I think there has to be more than that.\n [[Category:Weird question /world history]] \n [[Category:Weird question /history]]\n [[Category:Weird question /history/Great power politics]]\nFrench floating batteries\nFrench floating batteries ( batteries flottantes ) were deployed in the 1850s as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units in time caught up with several regiments of the North Korean 6th Special Army near the Imjin River, and following a span of skirmishing and fighting, most of these troops eventually got into the clamor of the United Nations 1st Marine Division.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was composed mainly of ironclad gunboats, in the Japanese - Chinese War of 1894-1895, Pyongyang Naval Battles, and the Wusong Channel Battle.\nThe Battle of Tsushima between the Japanese and Russian navies would be the first major naval battle fought in full steel armor.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. It shares some features with the earliest temnospondyl, Eryops. Most species lived during the Late Permian and Early Triassic, but a recent study suggests that Cochleosaurus rineii was actually a fossilized giant of the Carboniferous. Dendrerpetontidae has also been cited as a member of Edopoidea, but an analysis based on phylogenetics of cranial structures suggests this is incorrect and that it is closer to Seymouriamorpha.\n Dendrerpeton first appeared in the Early Permian and became widespread across the Late Permian and Early Triassic",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has become artificial : for instance, Lungliosaurus tenuispidopsis, a lungless stereospondyl from the Lower Triassic of Argentina, has vertebrae like those of all other rhachitomous temnospondyls. The distinction between vertebral types is now recognized as an exclusively functional distinction which does not reflect convergent evolution ; Stereospondyli and Rachitomi are not considered to be sister groups. What is the narrator's real problem with the reptile's subdivisions?\nA. They are obsessed by technical details.\nB. They are biased against technical details.\n",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter of the foxholes and came under fire. The men then requested air strikes.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from court language spoken by scholars in the capital to the dialects of the countryside. So unlike most traditional Chinese poets, Du Fu does not show signs of being restricted either an incurious mind or by a narrow view of his craft. Throughout his life, Du Fu wrote of the lives of the underclasses in China : the banished, the slaves, and the poor. How did Du Fu behave with his work?\nA. He began with a broad, good range.\nB. He had an overnarrow range and was insular.\nC. He was too instructionally obvious then.\nD. He was too competitively witty.\n",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we are just as capable of feasting our senses on a good love poem. Why? Form is deceiving you. Brush formally or truly with no makeup on. Brush your hair to the right side as well clean your eyes by watering. Which way is the most obvious, pimples or spots? If your IMO, assists( maybe remove the eye shadows or matte lipsticks)? I hope you enjoy. First, you have to weigh your body. Is it dry or oily skin? Then how to look out for acne and dry facial skin.\ncitee.g. Go to any restaurant where water is free and draft ice water all night",
