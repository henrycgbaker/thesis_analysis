  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units in pursuit soon encountered almost no organized resistance and began to secure large areas of South Korea. What does the line represent?\nA. The battle was a complete UN victory.\nB. The UN decided to withdraw and avoid a confrontation.\nC. The UN lines were breached and the lines disintegrated.\nD. The first set of battles went in the favor of the UN.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: It was late August 1950 and the US backed UN forces had taken Seoul and captured all of South Korea.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was composed of outdated ships and took part in a series of engagements against Russia, as well as to supplement China's existing navy. Most notably, Japan had a sizeable navy when World War I started. Along with British ships, and German East Asian Division ships from the former colony of Jiaozhou, it also became a major participant in the Pacific theater of World War I. After the war, it was decided that China should retain the Japanese built light cruisers ; two with steel armor and fourteen with wood armor.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince Tatonga is usually quite attached to Aragorn, Nanuk to Shima and Geronimo to Kaspar and Yukon to both Kaspar and Shima, a kind of consensus is to be expected: There will be peace between Kaspar and Shima on one side and Aragorn, Shima and Kaspar on the other. But then comes Geronimo and goes there \"Eish \u2026 guys, here, I'll let myself kill you in a duel\".

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Carboniferous. Later members of the family were found during the Permian. Edopoidea include a large number of temnospondyl species, with up to twenty-five species belonging to the family Cochleosauridae.\n Because edopoideans are the most basal of the common temnospondyls, many derived characters are also shared with their relatives and not found in them. Examples include four femoral condyles, an expanded cranial quadrate condyle, small orbital openings, a small secondary palate with several gaps, a primitive braincase, and short snouts. In contrast, these groups possess certain primitive features that are",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial and not reflected in the morphology of the skull, the most reliable characteristic of temnospondyl phylogeny. It is clear that stereospondyls include a number of clades ( groups ) of different ages and evolutionary histories, and so may be considered a paraphyletic group. Further research on primitive members of the Stereospondyli may allow the classification to be reduced to the number of distinctive lineages, and redefined as the sister group of the Rachitomi. Which of the following groups would a non-specialist assume has had a strong effect on temnospondyls?\n A",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter on occasion. After firing, they attempted to scramble back through the supporting fire, getting injured or captured. Why was the situation improving during the first few days of the US intervention?\nA.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, many of which were almost forgotten by his contemporaries. In Du Fu's last decade, poetry's official \" cultural content \" gave way to psychological introspection and to a much more refined, personal voice. His place in history was ensured when, in 846, a group of his poems were issued in government printing, probably as part of the Song regime's attempt to justify its descent from the T 'ang. These selections, including a letter to Li Shimin, the future Emperor Taizong, represent an authentic milestone in the history of Chinese poetry. Du Fu is remembered for using \" regular or free form \" poems",

A hero today recalls his aerobatics battles for freedom.\nLike the boys at one time, \"I would do anything \u2014 I mean, I would do anything to fly\". I became the airplane every time I flew, and I absolutely knew I was gonna survive the war,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no fears of dying, no fears of being hurt \u2014 I just flew fearlessly.
