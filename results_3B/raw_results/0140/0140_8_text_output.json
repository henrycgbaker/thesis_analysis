The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was attempting to reinforce the Western powers in the First Sino-Japanese War. The battleship Mikasa, launched in 1895, is famous for firing the first shot in the Russo-Japanese War, and the Japanese naval forces went on to defeat the Russian fleet.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not clear-cut, as some stereospondylous forms have rhachitomous vertebrae and vice versa. In 1985, a new classification of temnospondyls was proposed based on the structure of the lower jaw. What may be the reason why the author is trying to change the classification of temnospondyls?\nA. They are trying to change the classification for their own gain.\nB. They are trying to change the classification for their own personal interest.\nC.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as a \" central figure in the novel \", and by the way Lieber's \" Jewishness \" is presented, as his \" Jewishness is not a matter of race, but a matter of experience. \". Rosenfeld concludes that the book is \" an extraordinary achievement \", and that \" no contemporary American novel \" has \" so much in common \" with its predecessor, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Rosenfeld was impressed by the way the book was \" filled with life \", and that it has \" a vitality which is not only in the language, but in the very structure of the narrative. \". Rosenfeld",
