  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until late summer 767. After this they moved on to another village called Huangguo. Both the name of the village and the existence of such a place have yet to be established with any degree of certainty, but since this is where the poet wrote two pieces of poetry at about this time, the likelihood is that it really existed. It was a hot summer in 767, but that was when a, piece of news finally came to Huzhou, near Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang : Du Fu's wife was dying. Du Fu wrote about this news, also at Huangguo, in the poem",
  "Vikram and Shankar\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 has been postponed many times so far and it looks like the delays are not going to end anytime soon for this Shankar movie. The movie is getting ready in post-production process but there are a lot of delays and issues that must be overcome before it can hit the theatres.\nTamil film sources say that at least another 6 \u2013 7 weeks of work is left for the movie but there is no official response from the team. Meanwhile, the VFX and CG team is working flat out to meet the expectations of Shankar. Vikram and Amy Jackson will be seen as an actor couple. There are some songs, song and number sequences that have been left incomplete. Also the track recordings are still incomplete.\nThe first look of the movie was a hit and that could have boosted the makers\u2019 confidence but now with a delay it is a cause of worry. Also Vikram is working on some big movie after \u2018I\u2019 and there is a fear that he might not commit to this project due to other things that are more urgent.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What event occurred during Du Fu's stay in Tonggu?\nA. Du got help for his financial problems.\nB. Du visited the Prefect's poetry show.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. Du studied at the government office.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:  During his career as a government official, poet Du Fu moved around the country a lot, mostly because he was expected to move with the Imperial Court, which often changed locations in China. Sometimes the changes were due to war and invasion, and sometimes it was just for prestige. This also meant that he wrote very little poetry while the Court was at",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which unsuccessfully attacked Fuzhou, Qingdao and Jinan in 1894. In August of the same year, a combined fleet led by Admiral Ito Heiz\u014d engaged the rival Korean navy at the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. By the end of the war, the IJN had one of the largest fleets in the world. The fleet played a major role in the expansion of the Japanese Empire in Asia, especially in capturing Korea, Taiwan, and the Marshall Islands. After the Meiji Restoration, the Ministry of the Navy adopted the British type \" Ironclad \" and built ships called in Chinese \" Kousatsu \"",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince Aragorn was older than his foster father Shima, his name change in old alpha form to Tatonga is inevitable. While Shima still needs a different fate for the female of the young pups, he takes the risk of spreading his idea of choosing the perfect pack to the male too: the young male who wants to become the one with a reputation to have would be best for his first female!\nAnd that is precisely what happens: as Tatonga calls his newest alpha mate Geronimo, in turn Shima also puts it to her new name Nyamaka. Since neither puppy is quite clear about the kind of partnership they are",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Famennian epoch. At 5. 2 inches ( 13 cm ) in length, it is one of the smallest temnospondyls.. All emydopoids had very long arms and legs relative to the skull, and their limbs were always digitigrade. However, like sphenodontians, emydopoids are diapsids, having two openings on the side of the skull for nerves and blood vessels to pass through.. The body wall was protected by osteoderms, which are like bone plates, usually found in squamates, but are found in other vertebrates as well. When",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is problematic ; individual rachitomous vertebrae consist of five separate elements, yet most sterespondylous vertebrae consist of six. This dichotomy is of no phylogenetic significance.

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower.

Two each Type 94 and Type 94A gun s ystem mounted on electric driven catapults for aircraft launch were added on the bow. Adding more guns was at the same time one way to keep all of the available ship s guns firing and adding 24 new and 8 twin 25 mm mounts did just that, keeping more of the ship's guns firing.

Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth.

Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we know and don't know, what we believe and why.
