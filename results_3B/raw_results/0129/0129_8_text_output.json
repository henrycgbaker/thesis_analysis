  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used in the Crimean War. Although unarmored, the steam-powered floatation was faster than other vessels. Unlike the American navy, the French navy retained the concept of the armored floating battery in the early years of the Franco-Prussian War and their first attempt in the Orsay canal between 1870 and 1871 was not successful.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had arrived in the Yangtze River estuary during the Sino - Japanese War. Japanese ironclads fought with success in numerous battles against the Chinese Beiyang Fleet, forcing it to surrender in the Battle of Weihaiwei on 17 April 1895.\nWith this victory Japan became a major naval power, and embarked on the construction of the so-called \" Great Fleet \", a task fleet consisting of an ironclad battle fleet, a 10-ship cruiser force and a fleet of modern submarines, most of which were obtained through purchase of British and German equipment and by the building of three ships in Japan.\nIron",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms was not based on the presence or absence of vertebrae, but rather on the presence or absence of \" basipodial \" vertebrae, vertebrae close to the head of the animal. In both the rachitomi and stereospondylous, all of the vertebral series may or may not have been in contact with the skull at the base. Why was originally proposed by many scientists in the past?\nA.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came.
