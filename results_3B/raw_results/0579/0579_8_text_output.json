  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early spring 767 until the death of the daughter in the family. What caused the death of the daughter?\nA. A freak accident in the house.\nB. An illness of unknown origin.\nC. She was abandoned.\nD.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is arbitrary. Specilatively, certain large microsaurids are clearly stereospondyls, but are rhachitomous when viewed from a \" primitive \" standpoint. What may be the reason for this change in classification?\nA. Rhachitomous is now considered a unique group among reptile feet.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. Rhachitomous is a usage from fossil remains that no longer fits modern classifications.\nD.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we think we know about truth, truth claims, and the burden of proof. Ultimately the program shows how people, most of the time, believe individuals and teams rather than opinions and ideologies. Which makes it more important than ever to challenge our own views and beliefs, and to listen carefully to the people whose opinions challenge our own.\n\"All of the above is offered with that most British word of English journalism - 'cautionary tale'.\"\n\"What is our Magna Carta, or our Christ but a comforting myth which enables us to cope with life's challenges; like trading a recession for socialism and arguably the sexual liberation of the sixties?",

The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words and creativity, sending love poems lets our loved one know how much we really care and love them.\nThousands of love poems have commended the beautiful event of falling in love because they are able to express what the heart feels and not the thoughts of the head. We can learn how to say \"I love you\" from the best love poets of all time.
