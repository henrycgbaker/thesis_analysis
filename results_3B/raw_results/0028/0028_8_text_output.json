  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War, but were used against the South African Republic in the Transvaal. The British also considered the building of a U - shaped floating fortress in Ireland in 1856, but the idea was abandoned in the face of heavy lobbying from anti - Irish es and clergymen.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which in 1894 proved unable to control the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Imperial Japanese Navy's development culminated in its overwhelming victory against Russia at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 which assured the Japanese the slightest chance of challenging the balance of power which the British had maintained globally for their entire imperial history.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous amniotes is no longer considered rational, as it is now known that many groups of stem reptiles had complex vertebrae. What may be the reason for the cause of this?.\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. Strict classification system by type of brain use very few times.\nC.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the hill, but were handily repulsed, at least for the day.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, everyone can find love poems from various genres to feel romantic for the one they love. Romantic love, as expressed in poetry, is a story of an emotion triggered by an uncontrollable surge of physical and spiritual attraction. Many readers start looking for a romantic love response from a piece of artistic prose. Excessive romantic feelings come from \u00a0the heart, which initiates a feeling of passion for another person.
