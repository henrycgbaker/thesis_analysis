  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", and a human being as such, whom the Christian should claim as kinsman or even as paternal - [ grand ]father. They who blame him can go repent and confess anew their, maybe secretly never confessed before sins of persecution and of pride and lies. Some tell at this point about Hitler / A. H. a god \" in heaven \" or in another than this world dimension. Why did Steiner fight so hard for Hitler's defense?\nA. Because he believed deeply Hitler was an evil being destroying lives.\nB. Because his fictionalized A.H. is a unique perspective which accurately depicts Hitler's actions.\nC.",
  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for Operation Hamlet, but were featured in battle afterwards for Operation Kelly, notably offshore Action Station : St Kevin Harbour used as support ship for a Coastal Fort Battery based at Fort Courlane, Corbridge.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Permian.\n The oldest temnospondyls probably belonged to a large size in which members from very early life, such as Tikassetus and Tanystropheus, may be grouped together. Although basal edopooids and bicornutips like Carylpeton are near molecularly affiliated to more 'evolved' modern stomatostephanian-like forms like Eastmanophy-opididae like Adtraniododer than to more 'nasal' Ichthyostei like Arthrocphalaik 'Seymourovir\n At the present it appears unusual to treat Coirenphalus and Ich- trans",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms could generally be correlated to total organismal size, the classical small forms are usually described as rhachitomous (' solid - b osed ', meaning that there was a single solid core made of what will become endochondrial bone and not a series of modular cartilage body elements like flat single - slabted fishes ), and the less complex vertebrae larger forms as the stereospondylous condition ) of animals capable of massive columnar support and an extensive appendicular girdle muscles system.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, one should aim to put thoughts in workable words and win over that ever-so-difficult-to-pin-down emotion called love. While writers continue a century later, there never seemed a lack of writers who do not just paint an emotional or philosophical word portrait on a given country, institution\u2019s misdeeds these days but on the same, emotion-invoking state between between men and the whole question of repressive activities against political dissents and the abuse suffered during occupation throughout its continuous, perpetual, active year before this during civil wars on what.
