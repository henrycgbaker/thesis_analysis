  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n The poetry of Du Fu is so broad in scope that it has been difficult to pin down, and the conventional understanding is of a didactic concern for mankind and principles.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for action during the Crimean War. For this reason, they served as breakwaters and docking facilities for several years afterwards.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pursued the fleeing North Koreans. What led me to believe that North Korea's withdrawal was a result of their invasion by the US?\nA. A successful UN counterattack.\nB. The UN supply lines being cut\nC. Their defensive positions.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: In North Korean history, the US military invasion was the 1950 UN intervention that led to the Korean War. So, option A, a successful UN counterattack, is the only thing that could have motivated North Korea to withdraw. The other questions suggest a dependence on their defenses, their supply line, or holding their",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why is Du facing financial troubles?\nA. Yan Wu is not helping him finish poems.\nB. He is poorly |!aceded 1.\nC. He is impoverished.\nD.

For example, poverty is likely to lead to poor living conditions: the poor may live in impoverished neighborhoods (with poor sanitation and unhealthy environments) and social isolation (from well-to-do, educated people). They may have few (or no) friends or family members who can help them. Many people",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had seceded from the Qing Empire, causing the First Sino-Japanese War.\nWith the showing of its ironclads and armored cruisers during the Sino-Japanese War, the IJN officially turned into a fully modern, unified navy with experience of combat operations. Since 1902, Japan used the Imperial Japanese Navy Military Crest which features a stylized floating Japanese battleship presaged as beheading Chinese bow ships.

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince Aragorn left the group, the relationship between Shima and Himber had become more serious.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls was shown to be both unsupported by available data and artificial, in that there was no difference in such characteristics as number of vertebrae or number of layers in a vertebra.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter in a few places, invisible through red dust.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we all experience love and all of its emotions. Thus, we might find it useful to look at such beautiful poems not just as masterpieces of literature, but also as novels of love.\nWilliam Wordsworth, \"The World is Too Much with Us\" (1770-1850), famous English Romantic poet who paid a great deal of attention to nature, here writing about how art has robbed people\nS: Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions.\nRomantic poets pay more attention to the world around then they do to man-made knowledge.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as a Jewish-Chief Feldwebel in the racist, but vaguely Soviet, army that had ousted the Nazis in Poland. Much has been made of the casual anti-Semitism in Lieber's hunts for former Nazi war criminals and bombastic denial of Jewish victims after the Second World War.
