In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n   The era was divided into five major subdivisions, viz.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be of use in the Crimean War, and the two German floating batteries Ophelia and Victoria were too large to pass the Suez Canal. When the French tested their battery, Tonnante in an open bay, in 1855, it kept good station. The French professional concern of the 19th century thus introduced a product that would bring a \" floating armada \" of the French Navy in the same role the floating batteries, and at a smaller scale.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units took advantage of this, sending a large number of units advancing along the lines, trying to cut off any retreat North. They attacks moved day and night, staying well ahead of the advancing enemy, so that the UN could not approach too closely, and so the North Koreans would know they would be taken while running.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been fighting the First Sino-Japanese War for operational control of Liaodong Peninsula.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Pennsylvanian. Because of the older appearance of some edopoid fossils, there are some authorities who consider them an asteriskate clade.\nPalamobatrachus came from the Late Carboniferous ( Kinne Valley Series ) of East Africa and Brazil.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls breaks down far sooner than one might expect at first glance. Why are the experts thinking about'Rhachitomous and Stereospondylous?\nA. Rhachitomous are bones on the exposed jawline\nB. Both are cynosures\nC.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and lay down dummy mortars. All remained quiet overnight.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the boisterous amusement of \" slaking my aches in the hottest summer, playing in the luxurious fun park \" derived from the Temple Games, to the stately piety of his odes to his fellow exam candidates for the post of Imperial counselor. Du Fu's packing of absolute extremes into a single line gives his poems a disorienting effect : almost as though an entire cake, lik the episode described in one of his eight - stanza verses, had vanished into a single mouthful.
