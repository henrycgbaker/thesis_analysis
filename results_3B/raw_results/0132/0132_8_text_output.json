  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nDu's \" poetry of nature\" is hard to classify : references to beautiful vistas and the shaky ground of the Yellow River ( example : Grieving Cowherd ) impart a general feeling of humble approach to the power of nature, and Yeats's influence is apparent, but Du tends to surround his phrases with greater diligence than Yeats, so that there is more in the poetry. Moreover, the subject matter of the poem probably induced Du to put great effort into the language, such as the prolongations of sound in lines 5 - 7. \nPrayer is more effective if it is filled with genuine humility.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units then advanced up into Jangan country to the Yalu ( Yalu River ). What is the main objective for the North Korean army?\nA. The US must all trapped\nB. There must not be a war on the Yalu\nC. Dominate South Korea\nD. They must have all South Korea\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The North Korean army was dominated by the firm belief that any North Korean forces to the south forfeited any claims on loyalty and therefore constituted a serious threat to any moral and political authority the regime had. The North Koreans therefore had to fight a guerilla war of sorts in South Korea",

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What might have happened while they stayed in Tonggu?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. They went to see a local farmer perform\nC. They contributed to the local economy\nD.

If the act described doesn't tend to increase a quantity (or decrease a quantity), it cannot be an effective act. Therefore, answer choices A, B, and D are incorrect. The answer is A. Du",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack?

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Devonian, whereas the youngest species of the group is Edopsbergia, from the Late Carboniferous.\n Some bare members of the superfamily, such as the youngest, Edopsbergia, possess a number of distinctive features, particularly in the skull and mandible. Their most interesting feature is the presence of a temporal fossa, which probably served to connect the outer ear to the inner ear. Edopsbergia may also have had a triangular, bony external acoustic meatus. In sharp contrast, no members of the closely related superfamily Capitosauria have a temporal fossa. Capitosaurians are",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms seems to be a synapomorphy of the group. So the large group Temnospondyli is now subdivided into those forms with \" rheocondyle \" vertebrae and those with \" illoquadrate \" vertebrae. I have always been a bit uneasy with an arbitrary set of naming accorded to subtle differences in vertebrae, and I found it is better to follow the Dan motion and DEN, and treat it as a single fundamental group. [ Note : The name rhachitomous seems of Latin origin. See Nussbaum and Cockerell ( 1976 ).",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the outpost, within twenty feet of the outer defenses, but were killed by fire from a.45-caliber automatic pistol. Why are the people so insistent on fighting the warfront?\nA. Beause they have already won.\nB. Because they do not have much water.\nC. Because they are all Americans.\nD. Because they have had enough.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: The soldiers felt as though the war was never going to end. This is probably what they mean in the passage.

  " In the fall of 1944, Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating in a freshman contest with Notre Dame and it was only natural that he would expect greater things of himself as the season winds down and the bright stars of the Michigan line enter their senior year. \". The article went on to comment that he had \" sleepy blue eyes that framed him almost gracelessly and about a five - block long arm, a good pattern and wide receiver's coordination that made it almost impossible for opposing ends to keep their hands on him. \".

This is the place that Guru Maharaj Himself selected for performing the last rites for His Human Form a few months before leaving it. As per His instructions, His Samadhi is built at this very place. Such is the power of the place that anyone who comes with a pure heart and a belief in Gurudev is cured of all problems. Many people have experienced His physical presence at His Samadhi. At the Neelkanth Dham there are two ashrams, an Akhand Jyoti of Neelkanthji and Gurudev \u2018s Samadhi on Kanchanvar. Festivals take place here daily. The benevolent Lord Shiva is worshipped here on four occasions, Navmi, Mahashivaratri, Ram Navmi and Ahoibaan.
