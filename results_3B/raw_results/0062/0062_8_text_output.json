  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units continued to advance along the coast, into Hanam and into Seoul. Why did North Korea abandon their positions so easily?\nA. The UN had captured some relatively unconnected pieces of the Korean military.\nB. The military abandoned their positions in an attempt to flee before nightfall.\nC. The soldiers who occupied the Pusan Perimeter were abandoned too.\nD. The North Korean general had been forced to withdraw his army.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Withdrawal may involve soldiers steeping their weapons for later use, or it may simply mean that the soldiers may move downstream, or en masse, to places they have not previously been.",

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why was this about an attempt at gholpeaky?\nA. It failed.\nB. It succeeded.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. His finances improved.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The solution for this one is based on the passage. It tells us that this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Because gholpeaky is the result of our attempts, when I say it succeeded, I am saying that he had success with his attempt. Since his finances improved and most period of life where peaceful, it is the happiest period of his life. Thus answer(B) is the correct",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which along with the Tokugawa forces had occupied Tianjin in September 1860 in a joint campaign as part of the Second Opium War. The Japanese fleet again participated in the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion, engaging the Nanjing navy in encounters in which a number of Japanese warships were lost. The Imperial Japanese Navy's rapid modernisation was of serious concern to Japan's rival Great Power, Russia, and in fact assimilated numerous technologies and military personnel in the course of the Sino-Japanese War.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls.

Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and why we feel so sure of it.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter ; partisans fighting on the outskirts beat them off. How were the North Koreans getting to the perimeter?\nA. They were swarming under the perimeter\nB. They were blowing up the perimeter\nC. None of the above choices.\nD.
