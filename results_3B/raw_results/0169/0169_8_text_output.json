The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which participated in events spanning from 1894 to 1895. Then, in 1898, Japan joined with Russia and France in the Russo-Japanese war, facing three of Russia's new battleships in what became known as the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The actions were a spectacular victory for the IJN, which had successfully used new gunnery tactics and had fought in shallow waters rather than in deep waters, to effectively concentrate its efforts on one hull at a time.\nAlthough the Dochukan clad in iron, the earliest armored ship in the IJN was Kirishima, which was built in Germany in",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous types of vertebrae breaks down under the dictates of tendency. Methods of classifying the different temnospondyl groups are therefore reformulated to fit into evolutionary and phylogenetic scenarios.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and there were many instances of armed sneaking attempts through the barbed - wire. When the regimental command post became the forward command post, most no decisions could be made in this ersatz mobile post still witnessing the night and day slaughter from outside the wire.
