  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had defeated the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1904 Russo-Japanese War. By the time the war ended, the IJN had captured a fleet of 45 ironclads, steamships, and cruisers. It was during the war that the IJN commissioned several new steam warships, including four modern battleships, two flying boats, and three armored cruisers. This made the IJN the world's largest navy in terms of tonnage after the Russian Navy. However, by the time the war ended, the IJN had suffered severe losses, and its navy was no longer the largest in the world",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not very clear, and does not correspond to natural groupings based on, inter alia, biogeography, lifestyle, feeding habits, and body shape.
