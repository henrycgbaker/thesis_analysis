  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until winter 767, where Du Fu had relatives in the civil service, which allowed him access to passable living quarters and a recipient for his voluminous output. Then, in early 769, accompanied by his wife and youngest son, he began the arduous journey downriver to his homeland, escorted upward through the broad expanse of the Yangtze estuary by several of his kinsmen in a barque of their own. Luoyang finally fell on October 5, 763 to the general Zhou, who had already taken the ancient peoples place as capital of the state of Dali : * * The",

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which featured a similar number of ironclads and the Kobe -based light cruiser Izumo. The IJN's naval technology was capable for long-distance fighting, so although it lost heavily in 1904 - 05 against Russia's white fleet, many of the IJN ships were not sunk. The Japanese grey-hulled old battleships appeared in the Russo-Japanese War, but the Russians, quite understandably, when in a long terrific battle, likely to lose them all, were absolutely reluctant to sink these old ships for fear they might sink the battleships sailing in the same waters as enemies.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Silurian period. Balanerpeton is known from one individual, and belongs to an extinct temnospondyl clade ( Balanerpetontidae ) that is sister to all other known edopoids. It is a member of Reptilia, in the class Amphibia, and may have been closely related to the living genus Caecilia ( Amphibia: Gymnophiona: Caeciliidae ), which is also known from the Carboniferous.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous fossils is not readily discernible until the earliest Carboniferous. All temnospondyls have a complex rhachitomous autapomorphy, the terminal osteoderm consisting of a ossified internasal and two basal nasal bones. A complex rhachia was formerly thought to indicate relatively large and early fossils ( Abel, 1935, von Huene, 1936, Acorn and Milner, 1970 ), but complex vertebrae are also found in basal primitive forms ( Reisz and Scott, in preparation ). The centrum base also shows a large amount of variability. The bridge and",

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
