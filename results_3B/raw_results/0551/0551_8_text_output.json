  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications.

They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used during the Crimean War. Although the term \" armoured being patented in 1855, there is no definite proof that the British or French used anything more than carbon plated iron to arm their batteries.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was allied with the Imperial Russian Navy which defeated the weak Imperial Japanese Navy in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-1895. Learning of the Russo-Japanese War in the Far East, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany rushed warships to Shanghai, but neither side took notice. The Royal Navy stopped off in Yokohama to inspect the fleet and was impressed enough that the Royal Navy did not actively interfere. The cataphracts became the Japanese Imperial Hunters force.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Permian. It is circumstribal, having been recovered in North America, South America and Australia. It is the only cochleosaurid in Australia. However, other members of Cochleosauridae have been reported from North America, India and Zimbabwe. The family is one of the largest in Edopoidea, although the exact number of genera is debated. The name 'balanerpetonid' was used in the past to refer to all members of the Cochleosauridae family, but is currently considered a series. The name Marcelaurus came to refer to all three species of the family Marcela, but is",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not as sharply demarcated as was first thought. Brain size correlates with length discrepancy. Why was the radical classification made?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. Scientists united temnospondyls into one group.\nC. The science of phenethetics had not been \" bom \" at this time.\nD.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the wire around every foxhole and spinning overhead in the foxhole and repeated the requests. What may have happened before the third day?\nA. Everyone was sent to war.\nB. The weather was awful.\nC. Food and supplies were equally exhausting.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Usable supplies and ammunition reached their absolute minimum before the third day.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic wordsmithing, we are still capable of expressing our feelings with mere words. Romantic Poetry is a type of poetry that emerged in the 18th century from the decadence and conventional romanticism that came along with the 1800s. Romantic poetry and traditions, as well those associated with romantic love relationships, mostly targeting male/female relationships, are tremendously different today than they were in the 1800s.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, romanticism was all about lifestyle, thus so was the eccentric and unique approach to depicting love and relationships. Romantic poetry mostly involved bland love quotes such as \"anything you are",
