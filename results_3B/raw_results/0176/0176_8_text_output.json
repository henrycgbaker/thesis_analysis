Hawkes comments that, \" it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner \". \n While not everyone would be able to understand the full subtextual meaning or allusions in his poetry, an emergent science known as Cognitive Poetics suggests Du Fu \u2019s poetry is also alive with emotional content narrated from a point of view derived from his feelings about the events that he describes. In fact, Catherine T. Liu ( 1995 : 7 ) argues that \" emotional content both makes literal sense of abstract elements in early poetry by endowing them with the particularized significance of concrete things, and assigns to events concrete meaning by bringing the specifically poetic valences of these events. \u201d\nAlienating words were used,",

  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n This made Du Fu one of the earliest Chinese poets to express a \n vivid interest in art more broadly defined. He continued in this direction throughout his life ; he had excelled at painting since his childhood, was highly advanced as a calligrapher, and was among the first Chinese poets to compose songs in the vernacular.   Du Fu faced many problems and obstacles through his life. His father died when he \n was very young.

  " Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum \u2014 or homologous tympanum \u2014 to the inner ear.

The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these two groups may have evolved from similar structures under divergent selection.

  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", arguing that many lesser - known bombastic small - town German politicians of the late 1930s had indeed used increasingly intemperate language, sounding like Hitler.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to fight in the Crimean War, and were used instead as fortifications in Newfoundland in the American Civil War. From the beginning, there were plans to convert the Merrimack into a mobile weapon known as a floating battery. The most modest version was a vessel of less than 100 tons with a few rifled cannons that could be towed behind their destroyers or used to interfere with opposition coastal defences.\n<br clear=\"all\" /> One of the major weakness of the use of a ship ( brute hard - hit ) as a weapon unit is that its protection is disproportionally patchy - the stuff that easily accesible",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which occupied the contested Liaodong Peninsula. In the course of the First Sino-Japanese War, the Uraga Incident and the Siege of Port Arthur led to the Russian - Japanese War, culminating in the 1904 Battle of Port Arthur, the First Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Three Battles of Tsushima, among others. **During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan gained naval superiority over Russia with which it engaged in the Battle of the Tsushima Strait.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Permian. Edopoid temnospondyls have had a wide geographic distribution.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not very useful, as true stereospondyls in fact lack any stereoscopic reaction. What might happen if a taxonomist continues using this classification system in present day?\nA. They will have a hard time classifying some things.\nB.
