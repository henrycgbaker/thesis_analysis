  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n He was the elder son of a minor functionary with the court title of zaoke, and his father was designated a major-domo. His maternal uncle was an official ; so, his family background was of rough aristocratic status, termed the shi clan. That is not the designation of nobility, but of people who did not have to make a living from the labour of their manual division. They had access to rural land they could put to use. \nDu Fu entered the local academies as a child, helped by a relative ; he soon gave up his youthful pursuits of martial arts, and became more serious about writing poetry",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Crimean War and were used the following year on the River Cam.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack?

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Late Carboniferous. Balanerpeton is also one of the smallest temnospondyls known. The family is thought to have been divided into two groups - one from North America, the other from Europe. Dendrerpetontidae is known from several species, all known exclusively from the end of the Carboniferous through the end of the Permian from North America. Extant cranefishes are living representatives of Balanerpetontidae. All species are only around three to four centimeters long.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylus forms is becoming blurred, especially in Late Permian forms such as Micropholis canadensis from New Brunswick. The stereospondyls are aberrant temnospondyls that branched from other rhachitomi along a phylogenetic lineage that escaped the otherwise drastic restriction to a deep chloric acid chelophyte - like diet. The braincase was ovoid and brain cavity present, unlike in other temnospondyls. This estimate of diet partly results from the size of the external nares and vomerine vessels. They suckled in a turtle - like fashion, and had a tongue",

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter with white flags, relief in hand, but these proved false alarms.
