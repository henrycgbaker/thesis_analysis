  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the second Battle of Alma, in late 1854 under charge of CBE.\n What was happened with French floating batteries?\nDuring the French revolution, it was realised by them that democracy requires education and public interest so a plan to create people capable to assess any projects if they were efficient or defective and save money.\nWhile modernising the nation, in his first 8 years alone, Canning caused \u00a3 42 million ( \\1.35 million a year on a static nation that can support no bureaucracy ) to move from one system of war and defence expenditure in cash terms, \\1.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units then advanced toward Taegu after having gotten supplies shipped down, and advanced through Masan. During this three-week campaign, South Korea pushed mostly a line, now called Hogyes, stretching to the east into the mountains towards Pohang, beyond the 37o parallel, driving south the nightmarish Eighth Army and X Corps ( Seventh Corps having a casualty rate of 176 percent among its 194 companies and two thirds of HILLs VIII ).

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which attempted an Expedition of Chitos in 1895 \u2013 6, but this is seen more as building British rather than as the first test firing, with the more serious invasion trial at Siam marking success to find her maritime strength even before she got serious of training.\nThe Japanese response went through several phases. They developed two distinct types ; modern protected destroyers and experimental pre World War II cruisers. Japanese design philosophies of development remained pragmatic and experimental from their start, and in the years following were shown by British records.\nAdmiral Horace Austin Hobbs wrote about cruiser fighting, although battleship size became rare through those years",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Vis\u00e9an period, on the Devonian\u2013Carboniferous transition at about what were formerly central Spain.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylian vertebrae, that ascribed in structure to Rachitomi and Stereospondyl1 are believed to be the result of convergence by both sides.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came.

A hero today recalls his aerobatics battles for freedom.\nLike the boys at one time, \"I would do anything \u2014 I mean, I would do anything to fly\". I became the airplane every time I flew, and I absolutely knew I was gonna survive the war,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no fears of dying, no fears of being hurt \u2014 I just flew fearlessly. I flew this P40 Tiger as I was the airplane. Every maneuver was easy for me to coordinate \u2014 once I did it just looking to kill,\" John Dybdal, a WWII B-24 Navigator stationed over Burma.

This is the place that Guru Maharaj Himself selected for performing the last rites for His Human Form a few months before leaving it. As per His instructions, His Samadhi is built at this very place. Such is the power of the place that anyone who comes with a pure heart and a belief in Gurudev is cured of all problems. Many people have experienced His physical presence at His Samadhi. At the Neelkanth Dham there are two attractive Sadhanas.\nAt our first prayer hall of Neelkanth Dham, the simple place where Masterji\u2019s Samadhi and Shivaling are placed to-day, Devotees have a unique opportunity to stand at the foot temple of He whom the Hindus had reverence for all divine births in all ways.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person.
