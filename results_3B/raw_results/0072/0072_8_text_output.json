In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nThere is a great deal of information about Du Fu's early life in his poetry. In his youth, he had an aptitude for poetry, which earned him the title of \u201c Shizhi \u201d, meaning one who studies literature and composition.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War. After 1859, when all of the major European powers had adopted ironclads, they were relegated to auxiliary duties, being used to protect and bombard troop transports and to attack fortifications. However, they were sometimes used in the opening phase of an attack on fortifications to destroy the fort's gun batteries.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was allied with Japan's rival, the Qing Dynasty, in the Battle of the Yalu River in 1904. The IJN then began to commission a number of large armored cruisers which were the precursors of modern battleships. These ships engaged the Russian Imperial Navy in the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, and the battle marked the end of Russia's Pacific Fleet and the end of the Russo-Japanese War. Later, the IJN built several pre-dreadnought battleships which were similar to the British dreadnoughts. These ships engaged the U.S. Navy in the Battle of",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Carboniferous period. However, Dendrerpeton is the oldest species known from the Permian. The body shape of the earliest known edopoids is similar to that of extant frogs, with short limbs and a tail that is relatively long. Cochleosaurids are characterized by their toothed skull roof and very small limbs. Most of the features that make up the body plan of the Edopoidea were already present in the very earliest temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not a dichotomy. [ N ] rhachitomous = with an incomplete neural arch\nstem, stalk\n, phalange\na form of support, like a crutch\nRhachitomous tetrapods ( from rhachis = stem, stalk ) include many of the earliest tetrapods, such as Elpistostege and Acanthostega, as well as the large temnospondyl groups Aistopoda and Trematopoda.

Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
