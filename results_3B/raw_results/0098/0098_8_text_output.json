  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the Crimean War, where they reportedly did little damage to Russian defenses. What does the passage say about the French floating batteries?\nA. They were fitted with metal casings\nB. They were used in the Crimean war.\nC. They were ineffective\nD. They were armored to protect them from cannon fire\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: the passage mentions that the French wines were armored using metal casings. They were fitted with metal casings. Based on the context it can be reasoned that the passage mentions that the French floating batteries in the Crimean war and Italian War were armored for protection, from cannon fire",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units organized the North Korean Army, many captured men destroying equipment, abandoning supplies. Which year was this excerpt about?\nA.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to autumn 766, but Du Fu was paid sustenance only by the most generous banyan merchants and never returned there ; rather he took the next boat northward down the river and he and his son went alone through Hangzhou to the capital, but had to turn around and continue continuing down to Nanchang in Jiangxi province. ( He probably arrived there late autumn 766 ). Luoyang was placed under siege until mid November, and then apparently surrendered ; but Du Fu, with little time and few possessions, changed boats and headed south to his childhood place of residence.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. When Yan Wu died unexpectedly, Du Fu moved to Jinjiang ( Langzhong ), and was appointed to the Jinjiang post of Prefect of Military Affairs. Ed. Note: About 5 years after Du Fu passed away, I will write a commentary regarding the era in which he lived. While Du Fu died in 70 A.D., we must keep in mind that most of the other historical \"characters\" were around much earlier in time ( sometimes earlier than we might imagine ). Thus, anything we may comment upon is going to be based upon the time period of the narrator. \" Before the emperor Chi-Hungmen",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had entered Japanese waters through Sakhalin on its way to war with Russia in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894). The U.S.S.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Pennsylvanian.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is subjective. Based on a comparative analysis of many vertebrae from the same individual, modern phylogenetics groups these animals according to differences in different parts of the vertebrae [ 1 ]. The basic division is between long - necked forms with ureotriche and air - sacs, whose vertebrae are stereospondylous, and forms with short necks without ureotriche and air - sacs [ 2 ]. Beyond that division, the specific relationships between groups are investigated ( see Jeffery 2010 ).\n Russian membership of this group in the Russian Federation is very",

Delicate processing, skilful playing and expert composition coalesce to create an intricate palette of sonic lushness with which to colour your productions.\nTucked away in this library you\u2019ll find moody piano samples, spacious strings, biting synths, rolling grooves, evolving sequences, crispy foley and washed out pads, all imbued with a high sounding sheen that makes them all go beautifully together.\nBut this collection has more purpose than just being a sonic playground; as is evidenced by the contents themselves, it\u2019s a truly epic creative force.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \".
