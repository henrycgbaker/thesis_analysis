  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n Qing dynasty pilgrim and poet Li Yijie ( 1777-1803 ) claimed that he had discovered Du Fu's tomb near the Kuizhou River in Chongqing prefecture. However, at the time the tomb was not treated with reverence, and one person, desiring to use it as shelter, cut down the tombstones. Khitan extremists forced those who lived nearby to abandon their cultivation of the soil. Traditional accounts of life after the death of Du Fu are suspect.

  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", a Shakespearean character. He further noted that the famous Jewish writer Stefan Zweig believed that he had Freudenthal's A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see combat during the Crimean War, but the British floating battery Glatton was engaged with Lave in the Battle of Toulon in 1857 and soutbseamed an expedition to Cherbourg in 1864. At the Mediterranean naval station at Antibes, France, until the mid 1960s, there were two big floating batteries, called \" The Ships of the Line \". Both were reconstructed iron steam vessels built by Armstrong, Whitworth, and Company in the mid 1880s. One was mounted in the harbor as a floating battery, but is now drydocked as a museum.",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units assigned to that city at the last minute lost control of it at this time, losing most of General Paik's best troops in the process.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was supported by the more advanced cruisers, the six Cochrane -class armoured cruisers, in the First Sino - Japanese War in 1894.\nAfter that war, the IJN constructed ironclad battleships by consolidating domestic resources. Initially, these ships, all built domestically, were of varying quality due to lack of experience. By the start of the Russo - Japanese War in 1904, however, comprehensive experience with ironclads and experience with building them with domestically developed technology became sufficient to allow for the development of new, completely original warships such as the Kawachi ( Eda-kun",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is now seen to be artificial and of phylogenetic significance. In taxonomic usage, the distinction between these two groups has no morphological justification. In an evolutionary sense, however, it indicates a break between two forms of sulco - centric and sulco - sacral vertebrae. Besides being rhachitomous, the analogy between Temnospondyli and us in using the term'sula ', for shells, is, I think, elsewhere also relevant : in the skull of temnospondyls,'sulci'are good lateral and dorsal grooves, as though deeply cut on",

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
