  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Crimean War, but were used during the American Civil War. In 1861, the US Navy's floating batteries were the leading force in the successful running of the Confederate blockading fleet from Charleston, South Carolina.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which bombarded Ciaoyu in November 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. The IJN continued the construction of armored vessels including ironclads, meiyo-yori (ready for battle in under one month)'s and migi-yori (ready in less than two weeks)'s armored cruisers and destroyers.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is very arbitrary, varying from one anatomist using fossils to another. As Clack ( 1997 ) notes, \" it is rather a question of continuous variation. Regardless of which system we use, temnospondyls are phylogenetically heterogeneous and are sometimes classified as stem - or stem -grade tetrapods, having been broadly affected by evolutionary events that gave rise to the modern tetrapods.\" In the phyletic classification of Hurum et al. ( 2007 ), the anapsid stem - group consists of audile - or tetrapod - hearing assemblages of Proto - Arch",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe. We see how well-thought-out traditions, sacred texts and everyday objects can inspire new beliefs, and how what seems like solid research can be a house of cards. And we examine what happens to people who develop new beliefs. - Consider how beliefs can be built on tiny assumptions - How making sense of the world can go really, really wrong - Watch how easily a solid belief can be overturned - What made people all of a sudden believe in May 21, 2011 - How close a plan is akin to a death sentence\nConditions libres ou \u00e9conomicques pour les diff\u00e9rentes entreprises en fonction des diff\u00e9rents temps.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
