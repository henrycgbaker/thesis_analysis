  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in The Crimea. They were later used with the latter in the Jutland Campaign of 1916. During World War II four warships were converted for bombing purposes, but were later condemned and sank.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units that held the village of Chuchivun joined the advance from the rear were able to move and turn the 2 nd Marine Division during the morning and they pushed south through the central battle area and entered Masan.

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to spring of 767, before once again continuing downriver.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why did he frequently move around China?\nA. He was an itinerant traveling salesman.\nB. He was frequently imprisoned.\nC. Most of his relatives lived elsewhere in China.\nD. He was frequently in financial difficulties.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: People who are often on the move have trouble forming lasting relationships, because they're frequently in unfamiliar places. So, too, people who repeatedly move from place to place for financial reasons might be more isolated. In addition, military people might be expected to change assignments often, a circumstance that might prevent them from forming lasting relationships. Poet Du Mu was often on the move. He",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was allied to the Qing Government at the Battle of the Yalu River, and subsequently ravaged and destroyed the village of Wusong on the 22nd and 23rd of March 1904. They also vindicated the native Japanese shipbuilding industry by building Hatsuharu in 1905 and building the 18,600 ton Kawakaze in 1906.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince then, the packs Aragorn, Kaspar, Shima, Tatonga, Apache und Geronimo have brought up their offspring while following the pack rules. Northern and Southern tribes have agreed about common rules and boundaries, determined at the moment when the Wolfpack Indianapolis moves in with the young Dzikedhi owldogs Roc and Cathy, which had been born in a more intimate pack setup.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous period. The oldest known member of Edopidae is Teneospondylus anteronotus ( 300-325 Mya ).\nIn contrast, the first constant synapomorphies of this superfamily are the presence of condyles on both sides of the occiput, a bone called the squamoshadentiform present on the lower jaw, the absence of a intertemporal, and the presence of a triangular fossa in the occiput.  These features have evolved, in some form, in at least two other separate groups : \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------T:      -----\n -----D",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has no bionomical significance. Thus, forms with few vertebrae, or with alternate vertebrae consisting of one element for the centrum and a separate neural arch element, were defined as rhachitomous. Others, likewise with a relatively small number of vertebrae, were defined as stereospondylous. There was a continuous unbroken series of \"sterospondylous\" and \"rhachitomous\" forms. This distinction is now rightly collapsed, using observations relating to ontogeny, because myogenetic alterations are more or less constant among rhachitomous forms. In",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, apparently fooling Schmitt into thinking it was UN troops. What is happening on the day?\nA. The weather is as expected\nB. The war is over\nC. The supplies are running out\nD. Nothing out of the ordinary\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Fiction authors often use foreshadowing in their stories to provide readers with clues about what is going to happen.

Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still express our love of love with poems of our own. The romantic poetry has finished. Can you write me some short romantic love poetry.\nThe art of poetic ode is that it seems easy to me.
