The program should be able to perform the following stack operations: push (add an element to the top of the stack), pop (remove and return the top element from the stack), and peek (return the top element without removing it). Use object-oriented programming principles to design your implementation. The program should be able to handle an empty stack, an overflow stack (trying to add an element to the top when the stack is full), and an underflow stack (trying to pop or peek when the stack is empty).\n\nSolution:Here's some sample groovy code that demonstrates how to implement a stack using a linked list data structure:\n```groovy\nclass Node {\n    // properties for storing info about node\n    int data\n    Node next\n    \n    // constructor for creating a node \n    public Node(int d, Node n = null){\n        data = d\n        next = n\n    }\n}\n\n\nclass Stack {\n",

They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be deployed on the Black Sea, but were used thereafter in the Baltic with the Baltic Ironclads in the Baltic Sea.

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is actually poorly marked. At one end of the supposed spectrum is found Taipotetrops, with two - vertebrae of equal size, a structure eventually derived in Rhinesuchidae, and at the other end is the genus Hamiltonia, which is rhachitomous, with a vertebra of about twice the width of the post - zygapophyses. och Von Huene and Carroll proposed continuing the traditional distinction between rhachitomians and stereospondyls and placing all other triassic temnospondyls provisionally into the family Stereospondyli.
