What are some strategies for selecting appropriate analogies and ensuring they enhance understanding rather than confuse the reader? The pursuit of these two questions is central to developing brain-compatible analogical instruction, a multifaceted framework for teaching that incorporates analogies within text-intensive materials and activities, targeting both comprehension strategies and scientific concepts. This article clarifies terms related to analogical instruction and synthesizes evidence of its efficacy for improving achievement on informal and standardized science texts. The article demonstrates how this emerging approach is distinct from traditional expository and graphic-analogical teaching, through a reading comprehension and science achievement intervention for sixth graders in an urban district, where students routinely perform far below state standards for English and math.

I'm sat here in a tracksuit as it's drizzling so I dressed for warmth and practicality for the school run. two boys on scooters and a mad mother chasing them just wouldn't mix with trainers. I guess it's one of those 'if in doubt, wear something else' days. I think I'm doing well to get here.\nThank you so much... I think it is also difficult to look syley ( I know it\u00b4s hard to pronounc in german but don\u00b4t hesitate) if we have a cieling heater.... Sometimes I can feel much warmer than outside... Although it\u00b4s snowing here as well, so I have to put on a big coat under my dress too. Have a good sunday.\nI could come from another planet and just simply say Obrecht! All fantastic",
  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to May 767 and then again for another year from late 768 to October 769. Why were the items with Du Fu no longer important after 808?\nA. They were very damaged.\nB. They were getting too old.\nC. They no longer existed.\nD. They were physically wounded.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The poem mentions three items that once belonged to Du Fu: a cane, a towel, and a bag. The first two are described as being slow to decay.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why is this period of time the happiest of Du Mu\u2019s?\nA. He was in a place he was at home.\nB.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which began retaining powerful warships immediately after the signing of the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War in August 1894. IJN ships later participated in the Russo-Japanese War ( 1904 \u2013 1905 ). After World War I, the IJN maintained several armored ships in its inventory through 1924.\nNevertheless, the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) lost its priority in naval weapons development because of the British Empire's implacable opposition to Japanese expansionism in China and its kowtow to the \" Big Three \" of Europe : France, Germany, and Russia.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. Ptaquisaurus roquforti lived in the Late Carboniferous and may have been the largest living or most recent member of this family.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous tetrapods is not entirely constant ; some forms display conditions typical of both, and some show intermediate forms. Much of the older phylogenetic classification of temnospondyls was based on an examination of details of skull shape ; only with the recent development of phylogenetics has a more comprehensive classification been possible. Some examination of the triangular shape of bones will be given here. What was the best way to kill the temnospondyls?\nA. Temnospondyls were grouped according to the structure of their sterums.\nB.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, where it comes from, and how we convert belief into knowledge and knowledge into certainty. The result is an enlightening conversation about the path our brain takes when a mistake becomes a certainty, how we make definitive judgments about everything, and how to arm ourselves against these pitfalls in the future. Right Between Your Ears is the indispensable guide to the pitfalls of believing.\nWinfried Menninghaus is professor of English and comparative literature at Humboldt University in Berlin in Germany.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter but continued to scan the area with machine guns and seemed unwilling to assault too close. What information can be concluded after reading the passage?\nA. The United States was fighting for a better situation than before\nB. The United States was winning against North Korea\nC. There was progress made on all fronts and the battle was a draw\nD.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, and he experimented both with Aboriginal forms, such as the xunl\u00edu [ Music App ] from mechanics or birdcalls, and with those of foreign origin, such as his quantum correspondent Puyi said in the late 1970s that he and Liu Shaoqi comparable. For many years, Du Fu's poem was a private affair, even as his disciples scoured the world for paper on which to set it down. And in most of its arrangements and variations, the poem steers clear of explicit sentiments, whether of the communal or familial sort.
