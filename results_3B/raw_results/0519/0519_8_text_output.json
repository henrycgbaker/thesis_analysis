  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had arrived to support the last Qing dynasty emperor (known in Japan as the Yongyou-ke ) in the Siege of Pyongyang in 1599 AD. The Japanese expedition sent to take over Manchuria was intercepted by Commodore Robert Kerr' s North China Naval Brigade (NCNB) in the August 1894 Yellow Sea campaign on January 17 ( Old Calendar ), 1859 during which the NCNB captured the Japanese capital.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Permian period. It has been referred to by another name in recent research, but Balanerpeton and Cochleosauridae were initially described in 1914 and 1897 respectively. Most edopoidean specimens are known from southern China and southern Africa. Edopus is based on the Latin for fishy, while Cochlea is based on the Greek for \"seashell\".[ 20 ] The cochlearia is believed, therefore, to have had a seashell-shaped upper jaw. Cochleosauri was derived in South Africa to have looked similar to its Permian predecessor during the Mesozoic",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous condition is a continuous one, and can always be pushed towards earlier or more derived positions at will. Although this is obviously unsatisfying, it is more logically and statistically correct to assume that there is only gradual change between them. The Temnadomorphi contain species that show characters derived towards both conditions ( rhachitomous and Stereuspondyli ). An extreme of the stereospoudlys condition was the Parotoides, an exceptionally primitive -looking temnospondyl with a small, single dorsal rib. This may or may not turn out to have originally been primitive. From what evidence I've",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the American foxholes, but the North Koreans would back off when the men began to return fire. The North Koreans even placed a number of grenades in our foxhole. As they started to arm them, American gunfire forced them to run back to their lines.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, poems remain one of most profound, moving, and memorable ways of expressing romance.\nThis will guide our mind and shape the poem which needs the words. Here, our thoughts would be focused towards the topic and the poet would start flowing with his feelings and the topic should be clear before that.\nThe theme of the story should touch on a number of aspects, all based on a particular genre and style such as romance, tragedy, or even comedy. Therefore a good way a good theme should be decided by looking the topic before actually giving it a shape.\nWriting a poem based on what the reader wants is a great opportunity to write a poem",

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.4%.\nHow have the numbers shaped up for Total System?\nFor Total System Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.54%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to convincingly make an earnings estimate based on the consensus, since both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate have shown a tendency to be updated following the quarterly filings.\n",
