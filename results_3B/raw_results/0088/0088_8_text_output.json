  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to fight in the Crimean War of the Franco-Austrian and French wars, but proved their capabilities by bombarding forts at Sebastopol in 1854 to break its defences and ensure a repeat of the French successes of 1855.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was sent to invade Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War. They adopted a new type of warship, the protected cruiser, armed with six 305 mm ( 12 in ) guns.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Pennsylvanian.\n These animals look primitive and share several features with zoologically significant terrestrially active labyrinthodonts. A number of supporting characters argue for a close relationship, including a lack of osteoderms, presumably due to their being \"hyropermeable, flexible, and thus unnecessary.\" Edopoids seem more primitive than Eryops and pareiasaurs.\nWinford May described a flat skull -and -body -shape similar to amphibians like frogs for Cochleosaurus is intelligent.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial, as projections on vertebrae are found in many rhachitomous forms. Most derive from morphological characteristics, which tend to emphasise characters unique to certain families rather than novelties. \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430?\nA. happy and proud\nB. joyful and exhilarating\nC. sad and pensive\nD. sad and broken\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Today, rhynchosaurian experts are in general agreement on their phylogenetic relationships : * Rhynchosauria is the sister group to turtles. * Marshos",
