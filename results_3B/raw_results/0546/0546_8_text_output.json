  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling? How does it affect the performance of a program?\nContext switching is the process of saving the current state of a process and restoring the state of another process. It is a fundamental concept in process scheduling and is used to ensure that processes are executed in an efficient manner.\nIn Linux, context switching is used to switch between processes that are running on the same CPU. When a process is running, it consumes CPU resources and uses memory to store its state. When another process is ready to run, the current process is saved and the state of the new process is restored. This process of saving and restoring the state of a process is called context switching",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not always clear, and the two groups are often found together in the same fossil assemblages.
