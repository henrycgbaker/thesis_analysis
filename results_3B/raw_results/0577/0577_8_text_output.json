  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nThis, as Tony Banham has shown, does lead to a different sort of poetry, one concerned less with the cerebral and with issues as multifaceted in their implications as the emotional climate surrounding repair and maintenance or the distress due to floods, than with the tactile and the visceral. In the same essay, Banham quotes the critic Liu Pi as having written in praise of Du Fu : \" scarcity of themes does not impoverish his poems, for his ability to freely focus his way of seeing on any activity whatsoever. \"   \n Statesmark\n\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0923\u093f\u092f \u0930 \u0925 \u091c\u0928 sapkamp       av edns        skns    thk",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units under Douglas MacArthur, widely considered the best in the UN forces, advanced further inland, inflicting stiff resistance on the North Koreans. The North Korean high command had virtually no control of their forces once they began the retreat. which caused the large number of casualties that were in attendance because of the large amount of casualties during war.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. The occurrence of a new, successful species of Edopoid Amphibian suggests that Cutepos and Dendrerpetontaur are actually basal Edopoidea. Dendrerpetontidae itself posesses several apomorphic, or derived, features, such as an occipital condyle ossified into a crest, a'more flattened skull', a cloaca that is'narrow and divided' [dorsal and ventral], and a pair of post- mural bones, which is'unusual anatomically in Edopoidea...

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is too superficial to hold much significance in classifying the group. At the bottom of this chart are some vertebrae of Stereospondyli and Rachitomi. Why are recent and modern phylogenetics so important?\nA.

Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it?

Now, take another drop of food coloring and mix it with the drop you placed earlier. What has happened to the first drop of coloring?\nThis change likely occurred because the gluten molecule in the food coloring were attracted strongly to the water molecules. These molecules also blocked the process in water by blocking the other water molecules from neighboring gluten molecules. This prevents the food coloring molecules from being able to mix into water. The gluten in food coloring blocks the gluten in food coloring from mixing with water.\nMixing will only occur when the gluten in water molecules draw together as they close",
