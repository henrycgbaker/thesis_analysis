  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had come to help the Chinese rebels in the late 19th century.\nIn the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905, the Japanese fleet was able to defeat the Russian fleet in the Battle of Tsushima Straits.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Mississippian period. This species is also the first known temnospondyl to be terrestrial in habit. The family is also thought to be the first known temnospondyls to be capable of terrestrial locomotion. This is due to the presence of a well-developed humerus and femur. The earliest known specimen of Cochleosaurus is from the Late Carboniferous ( late Bashkirian ). It is thought to be the first member of Edopoidea to be terrestrial. Edopoidea may be the most primitive branch of temnospondyls due to the presence of many primitive features ( including an",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous tetrapods is artificial. This distinction was based on the presence of a series of ribs and vertebrae known collectively as the parapophyses. In rhachitomous tetrapods, the parapophysis is divided into a number of separate elements, but in stereospondylous tetrapods the parapophyses are combined into a single element. The division between rhachitomous and stereospondylous tetrapods is a matter of degree rather than of a clear break. Temnospondyls are classified according to three basic types of vertebrae. In all cases, the",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and were seen looting dead US soldiers. After 30 minutes or so of this, they were killed themselves by mortar fire, air strikes and artillery. What is the reason for the mortar fragments destroying the radio?\nA.
