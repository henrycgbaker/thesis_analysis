  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", not meant to be a historical portrait. He was not convinced that similar features, such as F. W. Nietzsche's \" authoritarian bombastic self - commendation \", could have come about without Hitler's sympathy for such figures. What is a monologue?\nA. An independent Poem\nB. A speech by Hitler\nC. A speech on the Holocaust\nD.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Kinburn and were not used again until an expedition by which they bombarded Keyhole, a Russian battery on Shell Island in the Black Sea in 1854. Why did they use Ironclad Battery s in this battle?\nA. They wanted more firepower and mobility.\nB. They didn't have enough shots.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had embarked upon building a sea power by restoring the traditional Southern Song fleet now taken care of by Theodora Consort, after the fall of Zheng He. A bitter rivalry between Japan and the European Powers, especially Britain, took place since the late 19th century.\nMilitary prowess in their hybrid y\u014dkai dragons and their use of an imperial navy led the Japanese to prove power over the Western and Eastern world. The introduction of foreign naval vessels as the kaiten (magnetor locomotive) during the Meiji period encouraged the Japanese technology to acquire and copy superior technology.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the middle Carboniferous ( Stephanian age ). Cochleosaurus, however, became extinct during the Permian. Edopoids apparently went extinct with the Permian-Triassic extinction event, though fossils of related Temnospondyli have been found in the Formantian Age of the Triassic, indicating that several families became extinct as the Triassic began, and some families of temnospondyls survived into the Middle Triassic.<br><br>The superorder Lysorophia constitutes the largest and most widely distributed group of temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylian forms is much less clear-cut, and within each group there is evidence of earlier forerunners with characteristic histories of change. The rooting of four subclasses includes the Rhynchosauria ( including advanced stereospondyls ), consisting of forms with a rhachitomous vertebral column similar to early tetrapodians, and the Pelkeosauria, consisting of forms where the complex chevron-like rachidian vertebrae formed a coelacanth -like linkage. The middle and advanced groups of rhacitomorphous temnospondyls, the Lepospondyli and the Lys",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, poetic metres, and literary styles. Why did Du Fu's work become so widely recognized?\nA. Because all the subject matter was so similar.\nB. Because of his versatility as a poet.\nC. Because he was highly reviewed by Chinese critics.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Du Fu was a great poet.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, one thing we are sure of, however, is that most of us recognise these lines as romantic poems, in some form or another.

Love and the understanding of love have been defined differently at different times. Romantic poets translated this expression into various cultural values at different points in history. Every writer defines love differently. Love is an emotion that exists in different forms and has different angles to look at. So, it is not surprising that many words written on love have taken different definitions over time and cultures. In fact, love poetry is about",
