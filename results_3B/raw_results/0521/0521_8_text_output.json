  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units ignored their delaying battles, while continuing a rapid westward advance through Prov., October 2-3. The UN forces captured the main bridges at Masan and Taejon and maintained the pressure between Masan and Taejon. The US also drove north of Masan toward Pohang. On October 2 the area north of Taegu was reduced to a few square miles by heavy air strikes which had been conducted through southerly gaps in the mountains. On October 3, with only a few stragglers and pockets of defenders remaining between the Yalu and sea, the UN forces captured Taejon, and",

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which the British supplied during that nation's First Sino-Japanese War, while a wooden frigate laid down in 1893 as modernization was under way saw moderate Japanese naval expansion until the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. The battleships Minamide and Inamuragasaki collaborated with a number of older, cruisers in a successful attack on fortified Qing Imperial warships in the Spring Taku Campaign which led to Japan's diplomatic victory on the Western powers pushing them out of the Liaodong Peninsula and contemporary, privileged access to the Port of Dairen.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous period. Some authorities have, however, placed the Dendrerpetontidae in an order distinct from the Edopoidea. Notably there is a bone in the facial region called a premaxilla that is a separate element in edopoids and primitive temnospondyls, but is joined cranially to the snout in other temnospondyls. The same skull bone is variously known as the postorbital, postfrontal, maxilla, maxillae, and lateral. Late Permian genera in the family Cochleosauridae include Cochleosaurus suttoni, from",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms, once seen as a dichotomy, has gradually lost its utility. What may be the reason the writer has had to classify temnospondyls in a way that is no longer viable?\n A. They have had to work very hard to do it.\n B.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we really know about what we believe, think, and remember.\nThis mini-series shines a light on what happens when a set of circumstances influences the way people think... and when their belief, previously cemented in their minds, becomes so big that even when facts are discovered to the contrary, such beliefs are all they know and will not undermine their way of thinking. When the end was set, the trading floor abandoned and the departing employees told to go home early and celebrate, it would take time for people to catch on that the end of the world and their demise was not at hand.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, and he incorporated new subjects from his disillusioned view of world affairs into his verse. He wrote about idyllic pastoral forms and learnt new kinds of odes from a Chinese court, full of corruption. Du Fu was a much - loved poet in his living time figureheads in paintings and sculpture, as grand as Confucius, with his head on them and the scholarly books around him. In fact, Buddhist painters sometimes blurred him with the image of Queen Mother Zen, another personification of the abject horror of contemporary government.
