  " = = Background = = \n'''Coupling is the degree of connectivity between two localized regions of a system. Coupling between two parts determines the resilience of a system to changes in the behavior of one part, as system behavior is sensitive to the coupling between parts. In general, coupling manifests as structural or behavioral relationships between elements of a system. The following sections present theoretical models of coupling, methods for quantifying coupling, and analytical techniques for the evaluation of coupling. Coupling is integrated into a section at the end of some sections for theoretical and educational purposes. Given the quantitative metrics associated with complexity, this chapter explores the relative abilities of the metrics for quantifying the degree",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in 1855 to see action at Kinburn, but were operational alongside the ironclad opposite French iced harbor defenses during the Anglo-French Bombardment of Knynsa in March 1855. They were deployed in 1864-65 when three wooden ships were constructed to replace the failing Dee_County Line. Their succeeding swivel mortar boats were directly descended from these floating batteries. There are floatation devices such as battery''s used in the The alkymists. The device uses a gravity based battery, although on a small scale. Only a small amount of time goes by between reciprocating the reaction",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units crossed the Naktong River ( the border between South and North Korea ), October 5, and, for the only time in the War, pursued the withdrawing North Korean Army crossing the river despite the possibility of guerrilla ambush and suffering heavy losses.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was incapable of beating them at sea during the First Sino - Japanese War. During the 1894 - 95 Sino - Japanese War the IJN K\u014dtetsu and three other ironclads destroyed the capital ship Liaoning on July 17, 1894 as a result of an incident caused by gunfire, thus leading to the Second Tokugawa shogunate's demise.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls fails to correspond to the distinction between long vertebrae and short vertebrae. A narrow - brained crocodyloid, the genus Applegateia, known from the fossil works of Montana, shows stereospondylous - like vertebrae and is considered to be a stereospondylus.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and a single American soldier was able to shoot one of them near Point.
