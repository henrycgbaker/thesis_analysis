On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls appears artificial. A distinctive feature of temnospondyls unique to that grade was their well - known water - balling ability : when in a precarious position near the top of the waterline in vertical cliffs, temnospondyls could swim upright and release a series of large bubbles close together until the animal was safely underwater. My new hypothesis attributes their enormous size ( Temnospondyls reaching over 20 feet/6 meters), the development that allowed this astonishing adaptation, and, as a result of them going extinct roughly 185 million years into the Permian Mass Extinction and losing their",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the gate.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, you hope to be able to pen a few lines\u2014albeit it in proper grammar! And really\u2014you never know... you might end up just like William Wordsworth, the preeminent romantic poet.\nA romantic poet is defined as one that sets poetry aside from his other literary arts of his genre! Romantic poets generally seek inspiration in terms of self-expressive means via unique or metaphorically bound lyrical poetics. Along these lines, consider that French Poet Compte de Lautramante (1909-70) said \"I love love, and without being much of a poet, if I were quite bald I should",
