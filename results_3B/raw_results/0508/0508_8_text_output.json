  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. In February 764, Du Fu returned to Luoyang, but his health began to worsen. He visited Mount Jiuhua ( in Anhui province ) in the following year, in search of medicinal properties. Du's friends, the great Tang poet Meng Jiao ( 689 - 740 ) and his wife Lu Zhi, had an unhappy and stormy relationship that saw them go abroad. Lu died during the first months of 766. Du Fu and Meng had spent a night at one another's home before departing, but Du did not have an affectionate or even particularly strong feeling towards Meng Jiao.",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which attempted to retake Taiwan in 1894\u201395. The Japanese used this experience to construct a full-fledged battleship fleet from ships built in Britain by Vickers, Armstrong and Laird. They used it more comprehensively in their defeat of the Russian Baltic fleet at the First Sino-Japanese War in 1905, and in building a fleet of modern battleships by the end of World War One.\nAfter World War I, Japanese ships were outclassed by German warships in 1917; Germany built all her warships between the start of World War One and 1917 behind its U-boat blockades.",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Middle Devonian period. Ancestralia. Edopoidea include species dating from the Late Devonian and through the Permian.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls was based mostly on the structure of the skull. However, phylogenetic analysis has cast the structure of the vertebral column aside, in keeping with recent work in the evolution of the vertebral column from agnathan to amniotan reptile. What will be the expected result if you change certain characters within the classification of temnospondyls?\nA. Phylogenetic analyses will show temnospondyls to be in one group only according to the structure of their vertebrae.\nB. More changes regarding structure will be made until phylogenetic classifications agree.\nC. More",

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we need to convince ourselves we are right, and to see things not as they are, but as we think they are.\nThis is the full version of the documentary film Right Between Your Ears.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter after dark and were mowed down by antipersonnel grenade fire, but the main objective of the attack had been reached : the Americans had abandoned their position on Battery Hill and fled into two caves dug into the cliff face near the perimeter. All of the ammunition and stores they had were left behind and on September 3 the caves were blown up and occupied by US infantry of K Company, 2nd Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division (7ID).\nThe company was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Schmitt, newly appointed commander of 1st Battle Group, 32nd",

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, ranging from official, learned prose to poetic, colloquial lines. The former is especially important for a work which deals almost exclusively with the concerns of statesmanship. Du Fu was the first to produce full - blown satirical works in Chinese literature like \u201c A Journey at Autumn \u201d ( \u4e2d\u79cb\u904a ), whose opening lines are famous for their vivid description of the emperor's court, which in those days was a collection of incompetent, corrupt men : \" That year we entered the Great Palace...
