  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was sent to the Yellow Sea against the Korean Empire of Korea in the Sino-Korean War of 1873, and adopted a more complex strategy in the war with the White Russian Soviet ships in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. The navy was reorganized and the ships were modernized during the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Mississippian. Its closest relative is more likely a basal anthracosaur, with a wide array of plesiomorphic features. Edopoids are unique among temnospondyls in that they have expansive lacrimal bones which gaze broadly towards the front of the skull, whereas more derived temnospondyls have smaller and more reduced lacrimals facing toward the back of the skull. Dendrerpeton macrorhynchum is the earliest known member of another group, Stereospondyli, but it is more derived than Edopoidea. Edopoidea thus represents a clade of the",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions is a dynamic one, with individual species forgoing the stereospondylous condition for some time during their development. In fact, most stereospondyl taxa at one time formed part of the Rachitomi. The various anuran, coelacanth, lungfish and sale-successor pterosaurs, for example, go through a number of stereospondyl stages before entering the stereotypical condition. Eine Menge temnospondyls were stereospondylsome during their early development, so we could add \" stereospondylsomus \" in front of the taxonomic name to indicate",
