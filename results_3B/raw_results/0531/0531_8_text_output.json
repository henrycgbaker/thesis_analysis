  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n For instance, his \" Peonies in the Snow \" ( \u96ea\u4e2d\u6885 ), a poem about three enormous peonies which were one of few relics of an earlier time. Du's poetic sensibility was unusual, and has been seen as a forerunner of the poetry of the Tang dynasty. Yet he retained a fierce literary sensibility, owing a kind of ironic detachment to his predecessors of the Wei and Jin dynasties. \nDespite his successes, Du Fu remained a man shunned by the authorities, and he lived through a succession of humiliations. Perhaps he felt burned by his bitter experiences, possibly because",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to take part in the Battle of Kinburn, but were used in the next year against the fortress of the Kertch Narrows. Although the British batteries were designed to move around the battle area at anchor, the practice was rarely used. Tonnante caused several accidental explosions on 28 June 1855 and 17 August 1855, the latter being so serious that she had to be beached at Kertch for repairs. The batteries remained operational until 1880. Note [ edit ] {{cite web\n|url=\n|title=\n | work =\n |accessdate=\n | publisher =\n |website=\n}}",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous types of temnospondyls is not clear and it is generally agreed that many early temnospondyls were transitional in their composition of vertebrae.
