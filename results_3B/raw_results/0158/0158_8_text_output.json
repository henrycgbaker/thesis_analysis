They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until April 1967.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What happened to him based in Sichuan for most of the next five years?\nA. He was released from prison.\nB. His mind was taken over by aliens.\nC. He had serious financial troubles.\nD. He was banned from making poetry.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:  The answer is C because he was in serious financial trouble during his five year stay. Du Fu wrote aggressively to friends and acquaintances for money and gave poetry as collateral. He wrote like this in one poem :  When I need money and the sky rains wine for meIn the days when my Wall is not bombed(Yan 35 : ",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had also developed its strength, with great losses - particularly submarines and monitor ships - on both sides. The sinking of the Imperial Russian Navy monitors Darya and Dobrudja in the Russo-Chinese War in 1900 were especially dramatic as Russian armor between the barbettes was not as strong as in older Western designs. Laser targets were fitted on the old Russian ships to allow artillery to target armor more closely, thereby mitigating on the shock of combat in armor.\nIronclads continued to improve their protection; in the late 19th century it became apparent that hit-and-run tactics were no longer as effective as decisive naval engagements in",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince this pack was born it is evident that Tatonga has leadership talent. He is an admirable wolf with an imposing dominance, great fencing skills and is full of energy. This means that when he most wishes, Tatonga constantly has to subordinate himself to the 5 younger and more lively pack members. Worse, at the moment it is still unclear how the as yet untrained Tatonga would react in a real combat situation. However, it must be borne in mind that all of this rest on the expectation that his parents have not been overrun by \"Sin city syndrome\".\nFrom Studbook: W\u00fcrzburg, born in the winter of 200",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Permian, in sandstone deposits. This is a different locality from those known to Balanerpeton for other species in the family Dendrerpetontidae, and previous studies have not shown any similarities with the lower jaw of other Edopoidea, nor do they resemble any species in the family Dendrerpetontidae. Because formerly more members of Edopoidea were known to come from the Carboniferous, this taxonomical placement required greater consideration. Members of Edopoidea have been proposed to be the sister taxon of the closely related temnospondyl suborder Microsauria. Microsa",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is now classified as a character state, rather than as two predatoria. what would happen if the temnospondyls were to just lump together and make one group right now\nA. the temnospondyls would still be ranked in groups\nB. no biosphere, one fevered\nC. the temnospondyls would seriously be categorized\nD. nothing would change\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: an opinion and or hobby matter what someone else thinks or would like to do it isnt a true opinion or hobby but if someone liked the temnospondyls slowly becoming one group, it",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower.

Two each Type 94 and Type 99 shore and submarine mortar were installed on. TRACK - DEVIANT TRACK All requested changes and improvements to the Type 91 were implemented.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter. Why were food supplies exhausted?\nA. They were starving.\nB. They were plundered by the enemy.\nC. They were run out.\nD. They were stolen by other soldiers.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Depletion of food supplies would make the remaining food sources the group would have extremely valuable. It's likely starvation caused the death as well as devastated their situation regardless. The cause of death of these starving people would still be more from starvation than from other causes.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as \" symbolic executor \" to the voice of another so-called Holocaust Israelite, Dr. Heinrich Steinem. Rosenfeld believed that two stories, written as they were in conversational style, without the usual lead-up by the kind of setting - or place - descriptions and complex plot summary that has become common to the Holocaust novel, provided a different experience when the nature of Jewishness was threatened and the experience of causelessness.
