  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n Just before the year 770, when he was four years old, his mother died. She was buried with a bowl filled with stone for a pillow, for Du Fu often mourned his unburied mother and wrote a poem to that effect. Du Fu's father, who was severely disabled, has since been put down as being either a retired official or an illiterate impoverished fisherman. \n In childhood, Du Fu was good at calligraphy, according to some accounts, so good that his father made him sit at the waist - high table.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to late spring 767 with only a few brief stops elsewhere. What reason did the narrator leave true luoyang?\nA. City Center\nB. Safety risks\nC. War\nD. Returned\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: unsafe has a number of connotations, but the senselessness that is associated with it would refer to conditions where one is unable to engage in meaningful conversation, and is therefore unable to engage with others to achieve their aims or to express their needs. We read in this sentence that Du Fu and his family are at such a place, incapable of meaningful communication where others are trying to help them. This",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What may be a fact about the person in the travel guide?\nA. They are in Sichuan.\nB. They are a poet.\nC. They are in financial trouble.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: In order to answer this question, we need to take a closer look at each answer choice. Du participated in the events in 759 and stayed for a year. That means that he would have previously met the governor. He was trying to get funds from this friend that would have helped him financially. From 764 to 774, he spent most of his time in Sichuan",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been commissioned to confront the putting-down of the First Sino - Japanese War. Lacking the overwhelming speed of the IJN ships, the Chinese knew early that they were at a disadvantage. Today, three steam warships - K\u014dtetsu, Hizen and Izumi - are preserved in the World Heritage Site of Kanazawa Castle Park's Mikawa \u014chashi in Komatsu, Ishikawa prefecture.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince Ari (Kaspar) and Aegir (Shima) had experienced an enormous growth on a physical, emotional and social level, it was obvious that the three of them had to meet the three other pups, who had been around for a long time. The pups in Ure usually develop at a tortoise-like speed, 90 % of their intellectual capacity is reached at the age of three years. Only later, the hunting instincts grow stronger and grow out of the previous level of playfulness. Many young wolves must be separated from the pack at this age as they lance for themselves. By now, however, Geronimo",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Devonian. Edopoidea was originally described as the order Edopoda. The sister taxon of this group was thought to be Stereospondyli, however Stereospondyli were eliminated as the sister taxon of Edopoidea by the discovery of Dendoantiquus in the 2006 book Fins to Finch that belongs to the order Plagiosauria. There were also some questions as to whether or not Earless Lizards and Mud Turtles ( Dermatemydidae ) were part of the group. Some fossils of ancient swamp dragons were originally placed into several of the members of ed",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyl forms is not always as clear as indicated above. The stereo element does not necessarily have a single median ossification centre, as seen in stereospondyls, and indeed the number of ossification centres is variable between species. The vertebrae are so diverse within the diversity of temnospondyls that classification by vertebrae alone is likely to prove very problematical in many cases. The fossils in the collection are mostly in very good condition, as one would expect for fossils that are no more than 6 or 7 million years old. On average, you are....\nThe question is",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and seemed to be burrowing under it. What will most likely happen as a result of the situation described in the lines that follow?\nA. We will expect North Korea to win the war.\nB.

  " In the fall of 1944, Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the naive, youthful, and colloquial, to the flowing and archaic classical ; this unusual range accounts for his enormous popularity in China.
