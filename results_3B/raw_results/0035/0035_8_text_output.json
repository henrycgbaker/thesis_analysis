  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which landed at Fengtig in the First Sino - Japanese War of 1894. After the war, they were also used against the Korean army who landed at Chemulpo besieged in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. In 1898 the IJN promulgated the Cruiser Project to develop a larger number of powerful warships at the moment of heavy investment by both powers in armored battleships. The result was the construction of several cruisers, such as the Y\u016bbari elder and the Irashia class.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls on the basis of vertebrae is fraudulent because the number of elements is difficult to judge under skeleton, and the undoubted stereospondylus Bradysaurus ( South African stem - temnospondyl ) has a fully rhachitomous spine.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we do when we arrogantly imagine we know all the answers, and how this creates blindness to the validity of other beliefs and points of view. It also shines a light on why the distinction between belief and knowledge matters, both intellectually and emotionally.\nWe take positions on beliefs, we hold them sacred, and we often disagree violently with other positions. Jeopardizing these beliefs is more than a spiritual, philosophical or financial matter: it can be a question of life and death. The new science of remember-minds gives us crucial insight into how our memories define who we are, creating a sense of stability in a world that is neither static nor solid",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and fired rifles in an attempt to kill US troops who were returning fire. What is the job of the region narrator?\nA. They are a guide.\nB. They are a trench digger.\nC. They are a nurse.\nD. They are a war soldier.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation:  The sentence focus says that the narrator was on the front lines, writing the letters to his family. So, the narrator must have been in a combat zone being subject to enemy fire. He was a soldier, who also wrote letters from the field so he most likely was a war soldier.
