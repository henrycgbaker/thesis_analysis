  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in that war to see action.\nThe French batteries Kellermann and Dutroit then carried out similar operations in the Baltic in 1864, but during the allied expedition to Paraguay in the early 1870s they came up against the much more advanced Navy of Argentina where huge, strongly-armoured ships were even underneath the batteries to prevent their being sunk.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to late spring 767. When they eventually continued their journey, he was far weaker than he had been at the height of his powers in 759. Amid concerns that he might not survive his journey, Du Fu had been writing to a friend at Henan. He had heard that, under the new rule of the Uighur Empire, the country that his family had tried so hard to return to had now fallen from greatness and was about to become a vassal state. What nationality most likely originates from Louyang?\nA. Chinese\nB. Vietnamese\nC. Middle-Eastern\nD. Japanese\nAnswer: A",
  "Vikram and Shankar\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 has been postponed many times so far and it looks like the delays are not going to end anytime soon for this Shankar movie. The movie is getting ready in post-production process but there are a lot of delays and issues that must be overcome before it can hit the theatres.\nTamil film sources say that at least another 6 \u2013 7 weeks of work is left for the movie but there is no official response from the team. Meanwhile, the VFX and CG team is working flat out to meet the expectations of Shankar. Vikram and Amy Jackson will be seen as lead actors in I while Rajinikanth\u2019s daughter Aishwarya will make her acting debut. Kiara Advani and a, a Pakistani artist are also part of the film. The movie has music by Anirudh. The part of the climax of I has been filmed in Las Vegas, USA. Rajinikanth is expected to play a cameo in the movie after the wild success of his magnum opus \u2018Kabali\u2019. Since this is Rajinikanth\u2019s first project anywhere where he has acted after \u2018Enthiran\u2019, there is a hype about it. The movie is touted as a financially ambitious",
  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What happens to him as the Yuan dynasty lasts?\nA. He moves around the new kingdom.\nB. He isn't empress of it.\nC. He leaves the country.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation:   The Ming dynasty was a new kingdom, not the united Chinese empire as it was before. There had been a barrier between China and the foreigners. The dynasty created a reflection of what the dynasties before them had done. That is why it is puzzling that one of the emperors of the dynasty became an empress. She met the Yongle emperor, a cousin,",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Pennsylvanian. [http://www.utdallas.edu/~oliver/sc2/00sum/PisodProc/06Allman.pdf J. L.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms can no longer be made based on vertebral morphology -- which is one of the principal features of phylogenetic classification -- because there is no tree structure, or single diagnostic character, that shows the evolution of this variation. The anatomy of the neural arch ( one of the primary components of a temnospondyl rib ) suggests that only three of the early temnospondyl forms which now have rhachitomous vertebrae should have been included in the Rachitomi ; the remaining forms have simple vertebrae that existed prior to the appearance of any recognized \" rhachitomous \" morphologies. 2100",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, how we come to hold those beliefs, and how we can be convinced we are right.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

The article then went on to describe in detail Rifenburg's \" quickness and football genius \", calling him \" the blossoming junior Briggs \" ( Briggs was one of the Michigan greats of old ). What the author probably doesn't mention in that paragraph above is that Mr. D.B.
