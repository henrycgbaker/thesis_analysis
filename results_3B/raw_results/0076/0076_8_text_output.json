The four areas of focus in this paper are: (1) making analogies to program learning objectives in the sciences, (2) promoting casual reasoning in mathematics and reading through analogy, (3) utilizing analogy in an analogical reasoning task when learning to multiply by 20s, and (4) using web browsers as analogical lenses to assist one in reading.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications.

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to the autumn of 766. Why did Du not want to return to Luoyang?\nA. He was ill.\nB. He was deaf.\nC. He wanted to be more active.\nD. He was constantly making new friends.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Lying ill ( or pretending ill ) at home or otherwise evading active service has a dubious history of legitimisation in Chinese culture ( see, for example, the complaint-volume in complaint 11 :252. ).

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was leading the First Sino-Japanese War, fighting a string of battles along the shores of Manchuria, Korea and northern China, starting with the Battle of the Yalu River along the Yalu River, in 1894, ending with the Bombardment of Port Arthur and Capture of Weihaiwei, in early 1895.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous (an era of the Mississippian Period ). Its pectoral limbs are described as being wiry, and they are believed to have been used for swimming. Many animals, such as frogs and salamanders, are also good swimmers, and unlike most terrestrial tetrapods, temnospondyls may have still been swimming by the Carboniferous.The stem \uc721\uac01\ub958 ancestor \u672c\u7bc0 Vermilingua / \ud3ec\ubd80 \ud761\uc778 soleas do not seem to have an airway outside of the skull.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous conditions is not taxonomically useful. Familial relationships within the superorder Temnospondyli are uncertain, although the stereospondylous forms appear to represent primitive conditions. Sneak is the best description for the word subordorate, It means \"a lower rank, grade, or class within a series or range of related things\".  To describe Temnosponyls as being \" Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae \" is a little more challenging. This however is easy to understand and expand.  Two fish yes, but temnospondyls",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and tried to dig their own graves to detect mines and booby - traps.
