  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, why we believe it, and how we are convinced that we are right. The film is a fascinating look at the human mind and the power of belief. It is a warning of the dangers of certainty, and a call for humility and critical thinking. It is a story of how we can be wrong, and what we can do to prevent it.\nDirector: Ben Stewart\nProducer: Ben Stewart\nCast: Ben Stewart, Mark Virkler, David Cloud, Mike Hoggard, Steve Wohlberg, Mike Oppenheimer, James White, Ron Dart, Michael Brown, David Reagan, John Ankerberg, John",

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still write our own love poems. Writing love poems is a way of expressing our feelings and emotions for our lover. It helps us to understand what we feel for our beloved and it also helps us to express our feelings to our beloved. Love poems can be written in different ways. Some people write love poems in the form of a poem, others write love poems in the form of a story, and still others write love poems in the form of a song. Whatever way you choose to write your love poem, it is important that you write from the heart. The best love poems are those that are written from the heart.",
