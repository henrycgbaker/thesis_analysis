  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which sympathized with the abortive Wang Wei coup against the Manchu government though the victorious Qing fortified the existing Four Corner Fortifications and the relocated Imperial Palace during the Sino-French War. In response to the American Navy which came to be known as the Steel Navy, the shipyards of the United States, Great Britain, Imperial Japan and Imperial Germany gave high priority to the construction of warships with water-resistant body construction (forgeron ) as can be seen from the French Super-dreadnought.\nUSS Kearsarge.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. More recently found forms include Chimairachelys and Necterpeton, also of the Middle and Late Carboniferous. Cochleosaurus and Bauriaspis were of the Late Carboniferous, and the Mesozoic Ceratotelmatidae was also put in this superfamily. In the early to mid- Triassic, tropical waters became warm, and thus the top terrestrials were forced into the jungle. This left room for the trees to grow and allowed mylenotus to eventually gain dominance, causing the extinction of this lower supafamily of Diadectomor",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae was based far more on ambient, extinct forms rather than on any living organisms bearing these particular designs. However, in addition to living temnospondyls, rhachitomous vertebrae can be found in at least one archosaur, Manopterus. Manopterus is based entirely on material from the very end of the Triassic period. What may be the reason that the original classification isn't viable any longer?\nA. Temnospondyls did not have radicles.\nB. Rhachitomous vertebrae have diverged without regard to phylogeny.\nC. Stereospond",

Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we really believe.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.

Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the simple folk songs that some thought he had composed for his own amusement to the elegant court modes, and he frequently draws on the complete spectrum of subject matter from the anecdotal to the lofty.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words and talent, that won\u2019t stop us from writing love poems for our partners that make other howl in love and awe.\nWhat type of romantic poetry is common? Romantic poetry is most often written using stanzas, syllables, rhythms, rhyme, and words that focus on what is typically called meter. These days, anything but traditional poetry is also considered to be romantic: something like a prose poem or free verse don\u2019t have a particular rhyme scheme or rhythm to tie in with the traditional definition of romantic poetry. Anything that leans toward expressing a poetic voice or expressing one\u2019s feelings, whether that be through emotion or verse, can be",
