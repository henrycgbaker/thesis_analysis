Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nThere are even rare instances of philosophical poetry,[ p. 99 ] such as his famous poems on the natural world and also on his family's pet tortoise ( tortoise poems ). Poems on animals were among his most popular and widely studied works, along with nature poems. \nHe wrote almost entirely in Kunqu poetic manner, which required that poetry to rhyme, except where rhyme was not available in traditional prosody, interspersing the four-part rhyme within a verse to create a unique free - or semi - free - rhyme style.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to play a role in the Black Sea, but were used with some success against the defenses at the Battle of Cape Long Wellness during the Crimean War on the western coast of the Black Sea in 1853. The novelty of the idea of employing ships, attached to the coast by a single spar, to shell and bombard entrenched positions was not lost on the ability armies on both the continent and the colonies.\nThey were not used again by the French, but were highly effective in the wars of the Great Powers. The French retired the battery D\u00e9vastation in the late 1860s, abandoning the ship, which contained four",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units were in pursuit. What may be a fact about the North Koreans?\nA. They were losing to an enemy.\nB. Their army was unorganized.\nC. They were technological inferior.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The danger to the US from enemy attacks was usually a matter of perception. In late September 1950 the belief was common that the US would soon rush to victory and end the Korean War, and many Korean refugees were streaming southward in the belief that they would soon be helped by the UN forces. But the actual situation was more dire. The North Korean army had 300",

They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early spring 767.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What did he do before reaching the same level as Pei Di?\nA. He was studied by Pei Di.\nB.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was active much of the 1894 - 1895 Sino-Japanese War and then the combined Russian and Japanese fleets in the Russo-Japanese War. They were thus largely responsible for the fall of the Qing dynasty. In addition, these ironclads and armored cruisers contributed much to the success of the Imperial Navy during the early period of its development. This success led the Imperial Navy to maintain its maritime dominance for the majority of the twentieth century. The Imperial Navy proudly paraded the British-designed modern battleships Maine and Inyo to foreign visitors during the Taisho Era ( 1912 - 26 ). However,",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous condition is not a hard or fast rule, as many forms showing both conditions have been discovered. What will happen to the descriptions categorized above when applying the newest method of classification known as the Rhachitomous condition which suggests a molecular and protein based classification?\nA. They will be placed in a new box\nB. They will be eliminated by society\nC. They will be eliminated\nD.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter during artillery pauses but were bombed from above when they attempted to cross our minefields.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets.
