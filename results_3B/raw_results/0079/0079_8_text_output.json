  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not as clear as it once was. The stereospondylous condition is found in many forms traditionally classified as rhachitomous, and the reverse is also true. The stereospondylous condition is now considered to be the primitive condition for temnospondyls. Why is the author writing about temnospondyls?\nA. They are a group of animals that are extinct.\nB.
