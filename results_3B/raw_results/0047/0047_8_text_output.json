  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was to be dismembered afterwards in the First Sino-Japanese War. During the Russo-Japanese War, the IJN oversaw the construction of units composed of steam battleships and gunboats to facilitate the conquest of the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur. The Imperial Japanese Navy also acquired a number of armored cruisers and gunboats to be used in the Battle of Tsushima. The battleship Hiei survived the war serving with the Imperial Japanese Navy until she was scuttled in 1942.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the passage of the \"Union\" law, all wolves must once in six months leave their nests or abandon their dens and meet up in a shared territory: the Nurseries of the Toyen Hills.\nThe fears of the puppies will be unpacked: Will they survive in a shared territory?

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Permian. Dendrerpeton docimus is the most basal known extinct species, restricted to the Rhaetian portion of the Triassic. Their lack of a nasal and lacrimal bone, would strongly suggest a primitive tympanomaxillary articulation or a large contact area between these bones that has not yet evolved toward the modern one. When tympanomaxillary bones have a restricted area of contact with only a single articulation ( as is seen in modern temnospondyls ), it has been suggested that this feature may have arisen independently within Paleozoic lineages.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous groups has broken down from within the stereospondylous group itself, and it is now necessary to differentiate a ''prosternum '' condition from a ''pleurosternum'' one, regardless of the structure of the vertebrae. What may be the reason for the distinction?\nA. They asked a medical expert for an answer.\nB. It doesn't matter.\nC. They did it on purpose.\nD.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and why. Do our preferences or values affect our beliefs? We search for evidence to confirm what we want to believe. Can beliefs be inhibited? And at what cost? Two priests debate in Complex Time, a type of technology that predicts how people think in the future to determine the \"right knot\" for a complex challenge or problem. How do we know our beliefs are right? Can we be certain? The answers lie, as always, in complex subjectivity \u2014 a mix of feelings, information, motivation, and yes, even luck.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter at night, but our belatedly -replaced front line MG team at Bilodeau's place and our bazooka team at Toney's repulsed these dicey attacks.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still convey how we feel through our love poems.\nRomantic poems are lyrical utterances, typically with little structure and symmetrical verse values. Almost all romantists possess some literary influence on them. However modern romantics have only evolved as articulate intellectuals.\nIt is not easy to define what romantic poetry is. Millions of meanings of the term count. Like most western mortal, individuals look at their own romanticism to get an opinion of what romantic poetry can be like.
