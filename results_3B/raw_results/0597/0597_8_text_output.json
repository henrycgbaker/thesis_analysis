On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was hastily assembled by Admiral Ding Ruchang near the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in May 1894. Later, in February 1895, these elementary ironclads fought the gaunt Russian fleet in the Battle of the Yalu River. The warships' experiences at these two decisive battles significantly affected the IJN's design philosophy for the Modern Era. == World War I Kaiserliche Marine ships ==\nThe Wilhelm II, is the oldest surviving ship of World War I.

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms may be an artifact of their study in slabbed outcrops, since both groups were primarily littoral creatures with small unfused vertebrae. This confusion in classification has lead to a host of competing views of temnospondyl phylogeny. Currently, proposals range from two groups separated by a gulf, to a monophyletic group connected to lepospondyls ancestrally, to a stem group of early successful temnospondyls branched from a laternate amniote stem. Due to the way fossils are studied, we are only able to recover short sections of temnos",
