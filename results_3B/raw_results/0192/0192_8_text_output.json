When a process is scheduled to run on a processor, its context is saved and a new process is run. This process of saving and restoring the state of the process is called context switching. Context switching is necessary because it allows the processor to run multiple processes simultaneously. However, context switching involves a cost in terms of time and resources. It takes time to save and restore the state of a process, and it also consumes resources such as memory and CPU time",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not a clear - cut distinction. What may be the reason for a more viable classification?\nA. It is easier to understand.\nB. It is more scientific.\nC. It is more clear - cut.\nD.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can do to be more certain of our certainties. More importantly, the film shows how we can be less certain of others' certainties, without being judgmental or dismissive. It's a question of understanding. Understanding that how we believe is not always right, and that we can be wrong about our beliefs. But we can also be right about them, if we take a different perspective.\nRight Between Your Ears\nHow do we become convinced that we are right?

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and even got into one foxhole. What may have happened to the foxhole?\nA. The foxhole was destroyed.\nB. The foxhole was blown away.\nC. The foxhole was damaged.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: When something is damaged, it is hurt or broken.
