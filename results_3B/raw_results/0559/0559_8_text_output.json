  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as an allegory of the writer's own Jewish identity. Rosenfeld singled out the novel's final section. What would the narrator probably do if they were asked to explain the significance of the book?\nA. They would tell the person that the book is about a man who is a Jew and a Nazi hunter.\nB.

I say traditional because DisneyToon Studios is a bit of an oddity, and I don\u2019t believe they have produced a feature film since The Princess and the Frog. It\u2019s a production company, and a subsidiary of Disney, but it doesn\u2019t make feature films, it makes direct-to-video films, and I think that\u2019s quite strange.
