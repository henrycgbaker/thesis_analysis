  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What may have prompted him to fight for a precocious age?\nA. He wanted to assume power.\nB. He wanted to bring in money.\nC. He wanted to bring in order.\nD. He wanted to bring in peace.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation:  The answer is D. This was perhaps the happiest and most peaceful period of his life. The best information about Du Fu comes from two series of poems\u2014the Early Poems and the Later Poems. The partition therefore makes sense chronologically. Du Fu may have been hoping to bring in order at a precocious age to pacify the people of an area. That",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which visited Jiaozhou and aided France at the time of Fasheng incident. In 1910, two ironclads patrolled in the Taiwan Strait. In 1895, an advanced armored cruiser Iwami summoned the USS Portland to Wusipi to aid poor seeking the outside world, but it actually dragged the imperial Japanese forces for 133 days in the Eight Nations Expedition to the Ikshvit House.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Late Carboniferous ( Perry and Parham 2007 ). With the revision of Arivesaurus weinselein, the edopooid Chigutisaurus and several basal nectrideans were classified outside of the family Chigutisauridae and in a family of temnospondyls known as the family Chigutisauridae. This grouping is broadly supported in phylogenetic trees ( Sues et al. 2002 ). However, in 2007 Dong et al. did not support this grouping as it was based on incorrectly named specimens.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms depends only on the presence or absence of a second incomplete bar rather than on any difference in complexity of vertebrae. The suborders Rachitomi and Stereospondyli therefore do not differ in ability to achieve either polymorphous complexity. [ + + ] Recently temnospondyls have been classified in a phylum that includes frogs and salamanders. Some important difference between early temnospondyls and other amphibians. ( many of the features that defined modern amphibians are primitive in temnospondyls ), and recent work shows they are even less closely related to other temnospond",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, sneaking up to one position and standing close - enough for the South Korean company to stone - throw potatoes to.
