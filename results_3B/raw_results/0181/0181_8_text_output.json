  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see service in the Crimea. As they were incapable of causing serious damage to forts, both vessels were scuttled by the Royal Navy, even though the latter realized that they could be preserved and sailed into battle in the same role as the French had done. They were salvaged along with five others, those are now part of the RN Historic Fleet.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which sought to challenge and conquer Manchuria for the first time but failed with Russia's open support for Japan, while the IJN fleet began to challenge British control of the Pacific. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz8bMGGOWdw&NR=1\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz8bMGGOWdw&feature=related\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJwFSEt18WM&feature=related\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vgMn9XZng8&NR=1\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Latest Pennsylvanian. Edopoids were so primitive that no one within this clade was as large as a full grown man, some individual small species were no bigger than a mouse.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebral structure is blurred. One of the lowest stem - grouptypical temnospondyls, the family Adenopidae contained forms with rhachitomous vertebrae that do not fit the rhachitomous definition of \" vertebral arches that only become complete through the addition of jointed girdles beneath their anteriormost parts. \" Even so, adenopids still fit the rachitomous or rhachitomous classification.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we do and how we function as we navigate conflicting beliefs and resist challenges to our certainties.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but soldiers could usually scatter them. The ground around the foxhole became littered with the bodies of gassed or strangled soldiers and occasionally booby traps exploded. Where is the speaker?\nA. A guest speaker at a country club\nB.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still learn lessons from their great works and try to create our own versions of such works. The poem was really an expression of the poet\u2019s feelings rather than a manner of communication. The purpose of the poem was more to entertain and express the poet\u2019s own personal feeling, therefore these poems were more in the nature of conversations between two people. The poems were never intended as evidence of logical thinking. In fact, the poems were an alternate means of expressing their thoughts.\nFrom the words and ideas from Romantic poetry we can get a higher more exuberant interpretation of life such as \u2018life is a dream that is full of beautiful",
