In most temnospondyls, such tympanic membranes are present, but the tympanum functions in a manner similar to that of confdial fishes, in that air does not pass across it.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for action in the Crimea. They were both manned by artillerymen having completed their original sea time commitments. In 1855, Glatton was involved in a collision while steaming past the battery. The armoured hulk Meteor then superseded Glatton in the Black Sea for the remainder of the war. After repairs, Meteor was recommissioned in May 1856 and found employment with the Red Sea Squadron until decommissioned at Haslar on 20 February 1859, due to changes in naval strategy and the availability of more modern armoured vessels.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was deployed on behalf of Qing China, and thus Jutland-class battleships defeated the Yuan-chi fleet during the First Sino-Japanese War.\nThe IJN advanced in the ships and an important part of its fleet consisted of armored warships, mostly the Japanese version with Japanese officers though with British ships like \"Fairlmau\" which was renamed as the \" Appa \".

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous outlook is much less strict than was once believed. What may be the reason why the author did not like the classification?\nA. It did not put the Temnospondyls in order well.\nB. It did not classify things properly.\nC. It did not show temnospondyls properly.\nD.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets.

Every person experiences enough denial and pain in daily life without being constantly reminded that someone may not think that they truly feel love, but take my words for it. It is possible to communicate even the most secret feelings concerning love with the help of semi-formal little verses. My examples include: One special someone/A simple little prayer/I'll do",
