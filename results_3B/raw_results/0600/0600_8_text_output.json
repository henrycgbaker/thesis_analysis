  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is based on the structure of the vertebrae, and not on the structure of the skull, which is the most important feature for distinguishing between the two groups. What may be the reason the author is trying to classify temnospondyls?\nA. They want to classify them according to their vertebrae.\nB. They want to classify them according to their skulls.\nC.
