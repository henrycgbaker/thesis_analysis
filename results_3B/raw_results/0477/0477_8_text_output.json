Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What might have happened if he had never written during those 5 years?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. He may have been able to support himself.\nC. He would still be in financial misery.\nD.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was under British naval protection during the First Sino-Japanese War in which the Chinese suffered more than 12,000 casualties (both killed in battle and as prisoners of war ), while the Japanese lost only about 600. The First Sino-Japanese War was an event pivotal to the growth of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which until then was on a par with China's Beiyang fleet until the end of the war.\nAt that point the Japanese navy was already well into the conversion of its wooden warships to ironclads as they were the future of naval warfare since there was no way for wood ships to withstand the iron",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince this book is the last one of two (a conclusion could not be made) and I think it would be a little bit too spoilerish to say it's good, just read for yourself.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. B. woodi had an eulimboid skull morphology and no intertemporal bones. Like early temnospondyls, B. woodi had a simple dentition lacking premolars, and its teeth were placed in transversely elongated rows. Balanerpetoid teeth are typically conical or plicated, rather than having the flattened shapes of later temnospondyls.\nEdopoidea and the following superfamilies are all members of the group Temnospondyli :\nThe most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea, so it includes Ed",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not a clearcut one ; rather, it involves a continuum of variation. This fact means that a distinction must be made between \" rhachitomi \" in a strict sense, and a broader taxon containing many of the taxa considered as stereospondyls under previous classification. What group of animals is the question about their evolution?\nA. the evolutionary tree of the earth\nB. humans\nC. temnosponadlys\nD. their origins\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we can do with our own beliefs when things turn out different than we think. Right Between Your Ears also shows that it is possible to change our mind at any time.\nAn interesting and thoughtful film about the effects of a \"prophet\" saying the world was going to end in exactly one year. A number of people were so convinced of those predictions that they had quit there jobs, stopped spending money, etc. Unfortunately the film suffers from a lack of understanding about human nature and how our brains function to make decisions.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and even entered holes on the far end, but most of the North Koreans were shot down before they could close with the perimeter.
