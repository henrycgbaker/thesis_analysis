  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate in the Crimean War, but would later be used in the American Civil War. These were used against forts at Port Royal and Savannah, as well as in the Battle of Charleston Harbor. The American Civil War also saw the first use of turret - armed ships for defense.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which included ironclads of French and British design during the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Devonian. In this group, the intertemporal is present and there is a bone called the otic capsule present.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not one of morphology, but of phylogeny.

Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it?

It does not mix with the water, no matter how long you leave the jar alone.\nNow, add a small amount of oil to the water and stir it in. The oil disperses itself in the water, becoming a milky blue color. This change happened because the surface tension in the water was reduced by the addition of the oil.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the simple, earthy lines of his early work to the more elevated language he later used. Du Fu's work was not immediately influential, for various reasons. In 840 the poet Wang Wei ( 699 - 759 ), who had been Du Fu's teacher, wrote and published the first history of Chinese poetry, The Record of the Poetry of the T 'ang Dynasty ( T\u00e1ngsh\u012b-sh\u012b ), in which he stated that \" in the poetry of the Han period there was none worthy of mention ; in the poetry of the Six Dynasties there was none worthy of the name ; in the poetry of the",
