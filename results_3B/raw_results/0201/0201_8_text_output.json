Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \n \" Whatever things may happen / should really be the things of poetry. \" In his poems examining works of other artists ( at the Temple of Confucius and the Li State Study of Yan Hui ), Du drew some poems on the calligraphic and painted work of officials in order to express his admiration for the poetry incarnate in it, as well as its aesthetic aspects of form and color.\nFurnier's interpretation of Du Fu as a proponent of poetic empathy can also be found in other sources : Du Xin once edited a collection celebrating 40 years of Du Fu's poetry, Du Fa Yu Quan Kun",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units in South Korea following their evacuation from Inchon had joined the main forces, had come about 80 kilometers south into the area which had been held and then were abandoned by the North Koreans.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 763 until the early autumn of 765. What seems to play a small part but perhaps a major reason for this wanderlust was that not only had he at an earlier age encountered the failure of both conventional and Taoist religious philosophy and ideologies, but with the collapse of the Tang under the various incursions and inroads from northern invaders for this to be especially true -- yet there seemed to have been some sort of social earthquake, in an era dominated by ruthless repression and ferocious reactionery so he was seeking a home for himself and for our very existence.

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous early temnospondyl forms, represented by species such as Micropholis, seems to boil down merely to a lack of knowledge of the ontogeny and ontogenetic relationships of such forms. After the advent of radiographs ( see below ) all rhachitomous temnospondyls are better classified as comprising either a suborder, Rhachitomi, or an infraorder in Brithopoda ( containing the living lissamphibians, see below ) [ In your original text, I'm not sure about the use of singular or plural ].

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
