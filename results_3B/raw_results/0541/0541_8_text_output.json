He was in his homeland.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: The best answer is 'he was no longer healthy'. He was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What happened to him at this point?\nA. He went to the capital\nB. He was thrown in jail\nC.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was organized in a naval blockade in the Yellow Sea to prevent the IJN from bringing warships from Britain to reinforce the Beiyang fleet during the First Sino-Japanese War. The IJN launched the world's first ironclad battleship, the Mikasa, in 1895, and thereafter continued to build battleships, which were also known as \" Mikasa - type \".

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Carboniferous. Prolimnosuchus is one of the best known members of Edopoidea, having been found in multiple deposits, including the American Carboniferous. The edopoid Temnospondyli are grouped together, along with Aistopoda and Lepospondyli, in a clade called the Trematopoda. Dendrerpetontids are sometimes considered edopooids, as they have primitive features like the single occipital condyle, intertemporal bone, and lack of tympanum. Dendrerpetontids may also be considered to have had a dental formula",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not clear cut. Why are temnospondyls classified in a certain way?\nA. It's hard to say because they are extremely rare and difficult to find.\nB. It's hard to say because they are small and easy to miss.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD. It's hard to say because they are extinct and have no modern day equivalent.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Temnospondyls are a group of primitive amphibians with a variety of different body forms.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but were unable to reach the wire.

  "Could you perform an experiment for me using a jar of water and food coloring to demonstrate the immiscibility of liquids?\nGenerate according to: After a rainstorm have you ever noticed puddles in the road with glossy-looking oil floating on top? Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. The water and food coloring are both liquids. The fact that they don\u2019t mix is called immiscibility. Immiscibility means the water and the food coloring do not dissolve in each other. They are like water and oil. Water and oil are immiscible because water molecules are very polar and water is attracted to other polar substances such as food coloring, while oil molecules are not very polar. This means that the molecules in water and oil are not attracted to each other and the oil floats on the top of the water. It\u2019s like water and oil are just passing each other in the street and they do",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, you can still capture the beauty of love through your words, in a love poem of your own. In love poetry, romanticism is important because it brings to life the feeling of true love.\nWhat is romanticism? Romanticism, also known as romantic poetry, is a literature movement that emphasizes the individual, passion, and the imagination over reason and logic.
