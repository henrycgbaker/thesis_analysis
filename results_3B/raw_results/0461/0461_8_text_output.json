He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as a \" tragic figure \" who, though \" ultimately self - destructive \", is a \" hero of the book \", and he noted the book's \" almost total absence of a moralistic tone \", which, he said, was due to the fact that \" the characters are so deeply flawed \".

Each era has its own merits, but for me, the Renaissance era is my favourite. I think this is because the films in this era are the most unique, and have a lot of heart and soul in them. The Disney Princess era has some great films, but I find it a bit too formulaic and stereotypical, and the Modern era is a bit too \u2018normal\u2019 for me. I like the characters to be a bit more eccentric, and the stories to be a bit more original.\nSo, let",
