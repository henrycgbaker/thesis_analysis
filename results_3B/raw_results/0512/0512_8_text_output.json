  "Can you explain the concept of context switching in the Linux process scheduling?.\n\nQuestion: Can you explain the context switching costs in Linux process scheduling? Can it be reduced?\n\nSolution: Yes, we can. Context switching is a term used to describe the act of saving all register values and process state information so that they can be restored into some other memory location. It costs time because of the complexity involved in this operation. We can reduce cost by optimizing our applications so there is less overhead required to switch between contexts. For example, if an application performed atomic operations like adding numbers or comparing strings, then switching between contexts would not be required since none of the registers values would ever change during such operations.\n\nTo see",

  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nThis interest in describing \" non - poetic \" topics was continued by a whole group of literary figures and poets from the five dynasties. Li Bai, Du's contemporaries, vividly described the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi, a highly accomplished calligrapher. This had a signifigant impact on Chinese calligraphy and remains very popular today. Li travelled around the east in his early years and produced such travelogues as Calligraphy Records of a Traveler ( \u6b66\u5eb7\u884c\u4e0d\u6f06\u8859\u8a18 ).

In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nDu Fu passed the provincial examination with flying colors, and his graduation poem was one of the most recognized in classical Chinese. In 735, at the age of 23, he entered government service, working as an editor and historian. In 737 he married the wife of Emperor Xuanzong.

The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be deployed against the 1855 Crimean War landings, but took part in further conflicts, including a Military Survey of the Dardanelles in 1854. The Russian navy acquired six iron-clad ships in 1850s, including the steam-gunboats Siraya, Konstantin and dauntless. Konstantin was armed with seven. 57 caliber Mark V rifled guns, she was also equipped with a demountable ram. The batteries sustained major damage at the Battle of Kinburn.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which went several years unchallenged, giving the IJN the experience to match their technological advantages with sound tactics.\nSeveral years of unchallenged naval superiority gave way to the onset of modern Japan's Asian empire, which culminated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395). After the Boxer Rebellion, American hegemony reduced Japan's offensive capabilities, but in May 1907, the IJN's best armored cruiser, Takao, outclassed four American battleships : Texas, Wisconsin, Mississippi, and New York, despite own 20-years of technological and age inferiority.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince there have been some other books on wolf packs appearing online, Hilary Lake developed a new storyline setting for her novel. In spite of her effort she has succeeded in creating an interesting and gripping story just like the first two episodes. In third episode she not only keeps up the interesting story development, but also introduces some new wolf characters as well as introduces some scenes the braver reader left for later before reading the first two episodes. When reading all three wolf novels together you feel complete and are able to assess the storyline of the development in a pack.\nHilary Lake author of the trilogy \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. Balanerpeton is now considered to be teleostean in nature.\n  Dendrerpetontidae is the most primitive group of brachyopsids and one of the oldest families among temnospondyls.\n   Another group of basal temnospondyls is Peradectidae, making up five genera such as Peratodon and Peratognathus.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls cannot be supported by cladistic analysis. On the other hand, Physetesaurs is the sister group of all other temnospondyls, according to a recent reconstruction by David B. Norman. [ edit ] Embryology Early amniote evolution indicates that amniotes grew as flying reptiles, not in water. Because they appeared immediately prior to the Late Triassic mass extinction, it is possible that they were in an advantageous position and thus produced large numbers of offspring, who grew up and survived the mass extinction.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we know about perseverance and rationality, why convictions can be surprisingly frail, and what that could mean in our lives. The show is presented as a gripping audio documentary by a Persian-American former seeker of spirituality who became deeply intrigued by the Living Church of God. After having films about their May 21 prophecy taken down from YouTube for violating community norms, her work on Why Are You On Earth profiled them as a unique world religion and a fascinating case study. With its epic story and focused lens, the next thread in the Life Compass series continues viewers on a global quest for what we are and what it means to belong to something. (51",
  "The YewdaleDefiant\u00ae R20W plastic crank controlled roller blind features a 40mm grooved aluminium barrel and white metal universal brackets for face or top fixing. The robust plastic wind mechanism ensures very smooth blind control, operated by a detachable handle (handle sold separately). The fabric is locked into a groove in the barrel, and features a white plastic bottom bar as standard.\nDurability and simplicity make the R20W a good choice for a vast range of applications. The detachable handle (handle sold separately) ensures the blind is vandal resistant and safe for areas where cords are a danger. The fabric is locked into a groove in the barrel, giving more durability than other colours and materials so that it can withstand the test of time and weather. A Velux window shade option is also available. The bar softens the knock at the bottom of the roller, which is useful for batten security.\nThe cranked wind mechanism gives the blind discursive movement. This is superior to the usual system of turning a small bracket on a universal joint. This takes a turn on any projected movement, so the blind will have lots of movement without a lot of turning time. For operation and overall looks we do not favour the Grooved Bar blind, a Coving",

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from simple expression to a \" brilliant and multi - couth style using a daring combination of artifice and high purity \". Early collectors seized upon Du's \" dazzling preoccupations with the contemporaneous forces of day - to - day life, which they found astonishing \". The political enmity and religious searching reveal the pathos and depth of Du Fu's sensibility. Of course, criticism focused initially on the overt meaning of the different modes of poetical expression, discussing the meaning of metaphorical, intertextual, allusive, onomatopoeic, and other \" special \" poetic devices.
