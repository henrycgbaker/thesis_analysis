The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see any service in the Crimean War, but after that conflict ended they were used in the American Civil War. The American battery Meteor fought under Bernard Beatty in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron and was in action during the Coast Guarding operations against the Staux gunboat during the Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Given its success in those Spanish waters, the ironclad battery Meteor was employed by the Union army to support the railroad conductor troops in the Wilderness of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia after that battle with Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Le g\u00e9n\u00e9pi Haszar otoman was another battery, and was",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What may have happened in December of 756?\nA. They lost a connection.\nB. They paid a fine and were exiled.\nC. They were often at home and alone.\nD. They had a bad childhood.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: You are reading a poem about the experience of Du Fu in 760s. Though he felt financially insecure, he experienced a relatively happy childhood, and learned hardship. Therefore, the right answer is A. They lost a connection. This choice best matches the poem's tone and attitude. The rest are totally wrong because the poem is not talking about instances when Du Fu connects with other",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was defeated decisively at the Battle of the Bangoko Strait in 1895. In 1896 the Japanese fleet left for the United States to attend the International Naval Conference held in Washington. Upon the rising of Katakurajima two elements of the combined American-Japanese fleet fought in the battle against Admiral George Dewey's and the battle became known as military victory for the world's first naval show-off. These \"matches\" of the battleships feared at that time were the \" Tsukuba \" ( \u53f7\u7389 ) and the \" Nagoya \" ( \u540d\u53e4\u5c4b ) of the IJN and \" Oregon and Arkansas",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Endwardsian Stage of the Wordian. \n1.  Superorder:  Temnospondyli\n-  One skeletal feature that can be used to distinguish temnospondyls from other lissamphibian lineages is the presence of the temporal-mandibular locking mechanism, which binds and maintains the jaw with the skull via contact with the occipital condyle, the medial abutment, the pterygoid and jugal. \n-  Another shared feature of the Temnospondyli is the presence of sliding interdigital joints.\n-  On land vertebrates, the pattern of",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not well - defined. What can be said about the history in the divided subgroups\nA. They may have had a one form but that is no longer viable.\nB. They grew larger and more complex vertebrae over a long period of time.\nC.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter during the night of 2 - 3 September ; however, none penetrated. They clearly expected ataxing assault that never came. The forward platoons were pulled back in defense, eentral platoon with Colonel Schmitt.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words and rhymes, most of us know exactly what love feels like and we understand the essence that poets have tried to be our wordsmiths. At ThoughtCo, we have a number of beautiful examples from the inspired poets of the contemporary and vintage world that can help us to recall fond memories and accept the unkind rejection that life sometimes throws our way.
