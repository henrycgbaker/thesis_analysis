  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in 1855 to participate, but following their success the old frigate Ramillies was outfitted with an upper deck over construction to create an armored deck capable of supporting the floating battery designs, and in 1856-1858 she was used to great effect in the Mediterranean, including off the Dardanelles, where she sailed up the strait and fired Russian fortifications. Ramillies was captured by the French in Tunis in 1861 and the design was adopted for the French equivalent to Ramillies, the Castor, with an attempt to second trial in Marseilles possible time.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which plagued the Japanese coast in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War in subsequent years. The armored cruisers Tokyo Maru \" Battle of Tsushima \" in May 1905, and the Yamashiro ko \" Battle of Tsushima \" in May 1905, officially marked the defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy, but heralded the once again changing Japanese naval philosophy, and the days of meaninglessly broadsiding opposing colossi, the hallowed tradition of Japanese naval warfare tactics that had served so well in such battles as Yashima and Ohsima.\nIronclads and battleships characterized most",

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the two communities only just learned to live together in harmony, almost the whole pack is sent for a camp in the water to rebuild trust and tolerance for the other pack. During a break and a lottery, rumors surface that the pups are barely able to handle the wolves and can lose control at any time. There is a critic but the young pups obviously rely on the community. The community supports the young wolves and this observation is shared with the wolf pack \u2013 and gives the community a very special present.\nDuring this camping time, some of Shima and Kaspar's blood must be drawn in order to document, who would be the dominant among",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has never been thoroughly investigated, because the earlier Phylogeohica classification lumped the stereospondyls together with temnospondyls. Most of these stereospondyls had rather complex vertebrae anyway. This makes classification moot. What was the reason for the early forms of the temnospondyls being classified according to the structure of their vertebrae?\nA. so people could show natural evolution of the various types of vertebrae associated between the two types\nB. so some people could show natural evolution of the various types of vertebrae that were associated between it and stere",

Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Notice that the color disappears after a while. This happens because molecules of one liquid cannot get inside the molecules of another liquid. The molecules of the waters naturally repel each other, and the molecules of blue-green food coloring molecules repel themselves, and as a result, those tasty food coloring molecules are able to naturally repel themselves inside the watery molecules of water.\nThe fact is that water itself is actually a mix of two parts, an oxygen-rich atmosphere and an ice-like molecule called hemispherinit. Hemispherinit alone makes up 40 percent of all water on Earth. These spheres, although",

So, to sum up our example, we must admit that poems are indispensable wheels to end strife!\nCould you paraphrase the statement \"Rom",
