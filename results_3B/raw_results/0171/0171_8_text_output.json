  " = = Influence = = \nThe first step to creating a successful influence design was to have an influence design group. From the idea to the finished product I worked with a group of designers. The group included our two lead designers, a graphic designer, a motion designer and myself. We decided to have a creative brief and after a brainstorming session came up with: \nWe didn\u2019t take the creative brief too literally and decided to follow the spirit of the word as we used these words to create an influence design that would capture the essence of this concept. \nThe main inspiration for the first influence product was the video game \"The Walking Dead\".

  " = = Background = = \nThe development of advanced medical treatment and diagnostic techniques has enabled patients to live longer, yet at the same time it has also opened a range of potentially difficult and costly clinical scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this has made the patient role in the clinical decision-making process even more crucial. \nHence, the role of the patient, which has been traditionally considered from a technical and technical-physiological point of view, is now also explored from a socio-anthropological standpoint, including as well the patient\u2019s point of view and his/her needs, and also the expectations of the family, the hospital management, and the health professionals.\n",
  " = = Controversy = = \nThe current controversy is based on the question of whether Jesus was married. The traditional belief was that Christ was unmarried. The Catholic Church supports the traditional belief that he remained celibate. This was not necessarily because he was holy or some higher status is required to go without sex. However this tradition stems from the Gospels, and the fact that Jesus was said to not be married.\nThis is all speculation and opinion as there is no factual evidence to support either assertion. If Jesus was known to have been married, then there is no evidence to support or deny that he had sex with his wife. This controversy has been fueled by a book written",

Most shells were either incendiary, tear gas, or smoke producing.\nAs the war wore on and air power was developing, shells were developed with the intention that they would hit their target, burst and send smoke/particles of metal to the sky so as to cover your troops.

This would be difficult, because Rohm was shot by two plainclothes policemen, and the testimony as to their identity and affiliation was largely, but not entirely, disputed.

  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment.

The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What type of job would Du most likely have worked at throughout his life?\nA. A historian.\nB. A poet.\nC. A writer.\nD. An actor.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: An actor would have acted out plays. A writer would have written books or plays. A historian would have written a history book.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which blockaded the Shanda forts of Tianjin. In response, China's new Beiyang Navy adopted similar strategies and tactics.\nLater in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, both sides employed armored ships, with Japan's armored fleets defeating the Russian Black Sea and Baltic Fleets in the decisive Battle of Tsushima.\nBy the early twentieth century, Japan was a major naval power in the Pacific. With a strong economy, it was a naval arms importer, initially purchasing British ships and then building its own.

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince we had worked with the first four puppies at Wolf's Lair (Germany) for a number of months already, we planned for a week with a team of 4 to 6 people. The dogs were allowed to work on the course alone for a few days, and were already familiar with two adult wolfs by then. We were very nervous because the fence that had previously separated the dogs was now gone.\nTwo nights later in the morning we went to Wolf's Lair in order to introduce the group of six to the four previously mentioned ones.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is difficult to define in most large tetrapod fossils. Finally, in one case of a large rachitomid, the vertebrae were quite simple. What time period am I talking about?\nA.  Triassic Period.\nB.  Jurassic Period.\nC.  Cretaceous Period.\nD.  Early Paleozoic.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: During the Paleozoic Era, terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates ( in particular, tetrapods ) developed many new, complex features. Because these new characteristics are present in a number of very different groups, it is obvious that they evolved",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but were pushed back. We killed 25 of them.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can make use of love quotes by famous poets to express how we feel about love. The romantic poets were a group of English poets closely associated with each other, who were active during the Romantic age of the 1790 to the 1840s. These poets wrote during a period of increased social and political change, and their romantic poetry came to be regarded as a reaction against classical and neoclassical forms of poetry. Romantic poets expressed their concerns about social, political, philosophical, religious and scientific change during the Industrial Revolution. Many of the poets became disillusioned with the state of Britain during this period.\nThe love of",
