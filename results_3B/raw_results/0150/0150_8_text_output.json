  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see any action in the Crimean War. They were then used in the Italian War of 1859, where they bombarded Fort Bard in Piedmont, and in the Franco - Prussian War of 1870, when they bombarded French fortifications at Strasbourg. The battery Metis was later converted into a floating torpedo boat and named Admet.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which participated in the First Sino-Japanese War. They later used their ships to bomb and blockade Chinese ports in an attempt to gain leverage for Japanese demands. Japan also sent its warships to aid the Russian Imperial Navy during the Russo-Japanese War.

The fence between the young wolves has been opened and the six wolves are permanently living together.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Devonian. It has been found in deposits in Australia and South Africa. The most recent edopooids are Proganochelys quadrate and the related Proterochelys ingens. Both of these forms are considered to be sister taxa to all other known reptiles. The former has been found in Cretaceous deposits in Canada, and the latter in the Late Cretaceous of the United States. These forms are thought to be the ancestors of the amniotes, the sister group of reptiles, including modern turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, and dinosaurs. ==References== {{Authority",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has been largely shown to be phylogenetic artefact. What might the writer have classified the tetrapods as?\nA. Amphibians\nB. Fish\nC. Insects\nD. Reptiles\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Rhachitomous means'having a vertebral column with a central bony rod '. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls.

Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. The food coloring will not mix with the water. It will form a layer on the surface. If you stir the jar, you will not get the color mixed in. The oil is a similar substance to the food coloring, and the oil and water are immiscible. Oil and water do not mix together in a homogeneous mixture. They form a heterogeneous mixture instead. The water molecules and the oil molecules are too different to mix with each other.\nThe difference between the oil and the water is the way the molecules are arranged.

  "How does the Most Accurate Estimate compare to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Total System's earnings prospects, and what impact could this have on the stock's near-term price?\nGenerate according to: Total System Services (TSS - Free Report)\tis expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.2%.\nRevenues are expected to be $906.17 million, up 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Total System?\nFor Total System, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Total System will beat the consensus EPS estimate",
