  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", a literary construct rather than a \" Myopic demoniac of fantasy fiction. \"The fictionalization is made most explicit in the New York edition of 1992, in which the first of the footnotes to Hitler devotees reads:This book is not a biography.He ( or, if you wish, she ) is a monk-novelist, yet not just a monk-novelist.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had invaded the Korean peninsula and Aegean-style tri-decker battleships for the Ottoman Navy. These ships, in turn, faced barque-hulled ironclads of the Imperial German Navy which, in the First International Squadron and later, under the flag-raising of Kaiser Wilhelm for the German Empire, were today considered to be the first fully fledged blue-water fleets, matched the limited efforts of the Russian Imperial Navy which concluded the high seas return of the Atlantic Squadron to the Western Mediterranean in summer 1902.

Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Carboniferous at roughly 365 to 314 million years ago.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondyl vertebrae is no longer meaningful, as it is demonstrated that rhachitomous vertebrae actually consist of a number of smaller pieces. What may be the reason for them saying that it is the rhachitomous condition that is not unique to one group of temnospondyls?\nA.

Ever noticed the oil spots that sometimes form in your chicken-noodle soup? Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Note that the color is not very concentrated, but it does show up. Stir the liquid by gently rocking or twisting the jar (never shake, you might have some oil spraying around). As stirring continues the color starts to spread within the liquid and a muddy color appears. The food coloring was not dissolved by the water, but was evenly spread within it as further stirring occurs.\nIf you now put oil (vegetable, mineral, etc) into the water, rinse it out with a few of the colored liquid then pour it back into the water, similar circulation patterns occur.
