  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for these actions and were employed on the Danube in 1859. The remaining French iron batteries ( Reine Blanche and Deux Deniers ) served in the Crimean War, positioned upstream from the mouth of the Taganrog River, in the river's mouth at sea, and to protect Odessa. The Russians sent their own floating batteries in an attempt to break the Russo-Turkish peace in 1853; the failure of that attempt partly helped cause the outbreak of the war, and effectively made the invention of the iron floating battery obsolete, being far too fragile to serve a practical military role after the Crimean",

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 through spring 767. What did you learn about Du Fu in the first paragraph?\nA. He was famous historian\nB. He was famous poet\nC. He was a victim of Alzheimer's disease\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Historians use sources to study history. Sources are things that historians write about the past, or things that were written in the past.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had invaded Taiwan in August 1894, and after victory there the IJN confronted Russian ships during the Russo - Japanese War that followed. Their North Pacific fleet consisted of four battleships, six armored cruisers, five protected cruisers, and six destroyers. They won the Battle of Port Arthur (January 1904), but lost to a stronger Russian fleet at Sulina Bay ( late December - early January 1904). In 1904 and again in 1907, the Ethnological Institute of the Japanese Society organized Pacific and Southeast Asian expeditions, with the first crossing through the Trobriand",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial, and ignores secondary symplesiomorphies shared by the two groups. The classification, then, must be restructured. But now the classification becomes very confused. There are artefacts, no more than a quasi - cladistic system, but arbitrarily based on structures. What classification may be referring to?\nA. Temnospondyls\nB. Urodeles ( or Frogs )\nC. None of the above choices.\nD.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, why we believe it, and how we feel sure. Right Between Your Ears compellingly argues that certainties are in fact illusions, and shows how backing convictions can lead to infertility, disease, homelessness, and even death. Through self-discovery and personal change these people learn what perhaps a bit belatedly we all learn: the truth can work its own magic.\nRead more reviews of Right Between Your Ears at iDreamBooks.com\nBNMaxwell Aug 13, 2013\nI enjoyed reading this book quite a bit.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter in full view when Schmitt die cracked under the strain of fire from machine guns. What could have caused such a heated situation?\nA. The heat was causing them to lose their strength.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. They had too much ammo.\nD.

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, ending gently for provincial officials on their way home from Changan and flowing vigorously when he was moved by an \" impulse to sing \". His poetic popularity posts two peaks : in 779, a year in which he produced more poems than any period of comparable length before or since, voters from all over China affirmed him \" most harmonious master of the field \" ; in 771 his home Puyang decided to rebuild his birthplace and honor him with a monument.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words as groovy as William Shakespeare\u2019s, we can inspire with our own words of love with the fate that romance and love shall never end. How do we make people fall in love with poetry? Should we start with a love poem? But there are some rules of writing poems that you need to follow to read a nice love poem or any other poems. There is no hard and fast rule but as my students know, rhyming and blank verse are used extensively for poetry. Rhymed verses are done for a full measure of verse in poems, with the first stanza in poetry being done away by the last meter and follow the structure",
