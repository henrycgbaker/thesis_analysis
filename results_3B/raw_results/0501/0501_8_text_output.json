  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Crimean War, and were deployed atadastrar against Russian fortifications in the spring of 1858. A design would then be considered for a mine laying purpose, and not trialled until 1863. With increasing knowledge of their effectiveness and a shortage of ironclads, over forty superfloating batteries would be built between 1864 and 1876 to be used in the Mediterranean for shore bombardment and mine laying roles.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was under command of Admiral Zuo Zongtang of the Qing Empire (Chinese for \" Eastern Fleet \") during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895. Once the brutality of the Boxer Rebellion was realized, the IJN warships from Hankow to Shenbao Cove were taken under steam and fire shells at Dagu Forts protected Dagu Forts in the Dagu area of the Chinese capital city of Beijing.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened.

But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince this series of images is from an Athabaskan family pack, the most rational decision seems to be to create one unified pack.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous. Balanerpeton was also one of the first animals known to have a neural spine separated from the vertebra by a cavity, and may have been part of a radiation of suspension feeders that fed on organisms that grew attached to rocks. Their lateral lines were apparently similar to that of frogs \u2014 the neural canals pulsate, stimulating the structures and organs that the animal surrounds and in which oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide can be eliminated.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is now considered arbitrary [ Peron 1990 ] and the \" Rachitomi \" and \" Stereospondyli \" are considered a paraphyletic grouping, and part of the Temnospondyli. The one well - defined group of stereospondylian temnospondyls is the Proteles. The most distinctive characteristic of the Proteles, a genus with few, if any, intermediate forms, is the structure of their vertebrae ( cf. Wade 1982 ) : a feature which obviously could not be retained through many, if any, intermediate forms (",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the U.S. and many tried to cross the open terrain in short rushes.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the lofty to the bawdy. The city of Changan, Shangque County, and their environs were among the major sites of irrational economic activity in the region.
