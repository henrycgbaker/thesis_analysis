The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in 1855, nor were their ironclad equivalents, mannerbuns and armeneck built until the 1870s and not in significant numbers until the Russo -Turkish war in 1877. Their first deployment came in 1882, during the Anglo-Egyptian War. The two Royal Navy monitors Cybear and Audacious were rebuffed during a move towards the mouth of the Nile, while the floating battery Spedewacky was destroyed by a landmine during its move in 1884. Their next deployment was in May 1885, when Spedewaky was sunk off Alexandria by torpedo",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units in pursuit followed. Why were most of the the North Korean armies attempting to get as much of their army into the north as possible?\nA. They were alarmed at growing UN presence.\nB. They noticed that they were surrounded by UN.\nC. They did not want to be die.\nD. Because most of the Pusan perimeter was evacuated.\nAnswer: D\nExplanation: Withdraw from is when you pull something or someone back, away from possibly dangerous or stressful situation.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early 767. Key Hamza Imam MPs in Afghanistan have stepped up \" the fight against terrorism\" and are \" making progress in consolidating security and further securing security \", his office said in a statement. What might cause Du Fu to travel slowly down the Yangtze?\nA. His health.\nB. He doesn't know where to go.\nC. Health issues.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: When someone is traveling slowly, they are doing something at a very slow but regular pace.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why does Du Lao have financial trouble?\nA. He was a mortgage broker.\nB. His crops failed.\nC. He was unable to farm.\nD. He was a farmer.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The above story is my own. His problems come from unfortunate circumstances out of his control.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which mostly comprised large dreadnought battleships ( liubei \u5b88\u9f61, lit.: \" eternal protection \" ), during the First Sino-Japanese War. Contemporary foreign naval observers described the battle as a see-saw engagement in which the Japanese proved to be the material and psychological victors. Before the war, however, the Navy was under the charge of 'Togo Heihachiro. The second fleet was Commodore Kamimura Hakuyu's First Fleet, which engaged two of the British's most difficult admirals, Vice-Admiral of the White Callaghan Hyde Parker and Admiral Sir Edward Cod",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Pennsylvanian, during the Gzhelian stage.\n Other temnospondyl families can be morphologically isolated from each other and are not closely related by a common ancestor. This arises from the disagreement of which taxonomic clades should be phylogenetically isolated from other groups based on morphological similarities as well as molecular phylogeny. However, lacking genetic data hinders their assessment.\n The similarities between edopoids are among the oldest forms of temnospondyls in North America. It seems that the family, similar to other temnospondyls, is associated with soft ground aquatic environments early in its evolution.",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous taxa is found blurred in new skeletal elements, such as ascending and descending ribbed urostyles which have never been confidently assigned to either suborder, or the lacertiform frontoparietal. The Hankela article did not contain any discussion on the classification of temnospondyls. What might be the conclusion of the passage?\nA. Temnosponderal animals have distinctive vertebra.\nB. Temnospondyls are continually facing confusion.\nC. Temnospondyls are very genetically different.\nD. Kinkelas are often confused with temnospondyls.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Early",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
