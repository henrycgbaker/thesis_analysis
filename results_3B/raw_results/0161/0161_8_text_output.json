  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Kinburn campaign, but both would play an important role in the 1859 campaign, particularly against the fort of Martini del Terziolo in the Two Sicilies taken from Austria, which they bombarded directly and often after a two to three hour interception of the enemy infantry trenches. Most of the resistance came from the fort itself, which was armed with 11 cannons. A breastwork of trees had to be shattered by all means to gain entrance to the fort ; finally the fort surrendered. They were operational again in the Franco - Prussian war, employed cheaply and successfully against the forts of Metz and Ver",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Devonian. While the most basal taxon is widely thought to either be Dendrerpetontidae or Edops, a recent study based on skull morphology argued for Edops. Others have argued for Dendrerpetontidae. It is thought that this family, though extremely diverse, represents only a single clade and should be considered a single species in a single genus, Dendrerpeton.\n Virtually no fossils of Early or Middle Devonian edopoids are known. Edopoids became more diverse during the Late Devonian, but they probably declined in evolutionary radiation early in the Carboniferous. The super",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has proven to be artificial, and the separate suborder Racichomi needs to be incorporated into Stereospondyli. For example, the genus Calamospondylus is a stereospondyle with a rhachitomous type of centrum, and Uraemus is a rhachitomous form with a stereospondyle type centrum.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter remaining very quiet near it. We fled back into our foxhol allowing one North Korean within 2 metre range before firing a shotgun resulting in a death. Another North Korean reached the perimeter itself where he was killed. Death was inevitable near the perimeter though it did not follow the same pattern until later on in the war when it was realized that the Americans were going to keep up a fierce defense and mortars, artillery and the infantry will do us in in that situation. We did not know then how fervent an attack we had received and how close we were and even later near the end what the North Korean's were willing to do",
