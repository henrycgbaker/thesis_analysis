  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 763 until late spring of 765 until they were allowed there by the military administration which controlled it. The official history makes no special mention of that time, either there or where ever else they spent it, except for one instance in October - April 764. He composed the poem ( quoted earlier ), in his own account entitled. Luowang ci, in which he described life \" at home with dear ones \" ( yi ju qi liang cheng jie ). Du Fu himself was a bit older than his wife in the year that he composed this poem, being born in June 753 and probably in that year of ",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What state did he briefly depart for before heading over to Chengdu?\nA. The Sate of the Liao People\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. The Sate of Tibet\nD. The United States of America\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: The Tibet people had made many wars to attempt conquer the Han people, and the later Tibet People Empires would often want trade to take place between their lands and China. Han would send a small army for diplomatic service purpose when they had occasion in exchange on sending some of their goods of special value such as their good quality teas or silk garments ( silk was very valuable",

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been sent to Japan in pursuit of the Shinseng\u0443\u043c\u0430. In the initial attacks, an Ironclad class warship named Yashima ( \u97a0\u5c71 (Chinese : \u8207\u56db\u4e38)), had been crippled by the Chinese warship Kegon.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Lower Mississippian of North America. Cochleosauriids are considered the most plesiomorphic members within Edopoidea due tom their overall similarities to Edops. They can also contain many primitive features like a single occipital condyle, though sometimes as many as three are found. Members of family Pedeetetodontidae like Cochleospathus are larger and are considered edopoiaform.\n The next most basal superfamily within Lepospondyli are Amphibamformes. This group was originally termed'microsyndyatomyid temnospondyls'in an investigation by Carroll",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not so obvious ; the primitive rhachitomous condition has been modified from one extremity to another more than once and in opposite ways in different groups. These facts make it difficult to distinguish one group from adjacent groups. Since so many characters can be shared, a phylogentic approach provides a way to compare such characters and arrive at an objective systematic arrangement of temnospondyl groups. In order to use a phylogenic approach, it will be useful, therefore, to use a hypothetical primitive condition that the evolution of any character can be compared with rather than to try to define a separate tax",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and took position on top of the foxhole walls.
