  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nDu Fu suffered from tuberculosis and grew up in a time of intense political turmoil. However, rather than reacting to the political fluctuations of his era, Du Fu seems to have rifted the chance to participate in politics for himself. Anxious to freedom of a poorly paid civil servant, he self - exile to the south, spending most of his official life ( 822-845 ) in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan.  The years he was an official were marked by warfare, famine, and natural disaster, as well as the collapse of the Tang royal house, except for the middle years during the reign of Emperor Wenz",

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which participated in an abortive attempt to occupy Port Arthur (ported as Dalian ) in 1875, which triggered the First Sino-Japanese War.\nThe Japanese had innovated with fleet defense systems since the departure of Commodore Perry's ships from port in 1854. Throughout the 1850s, regular military exercises and naval patrols were conducted during peace time as Japans' more warlike neighbours the Russians and Chinese made aggressive technological advances. As the Second Anglo-Chinese War (also known as the Arrow War against the Kingdom of Tibet ) was a significant contribution to the Empires' military machine, an Imperial Commission was established",

Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince dropping out of forming the band 'Sland' last winter Meinhard Zink asked Markus R\u00fchl to accompany him on several gigs. He was delighted because Markus' works are self-confident, minimalistic and dark in the purest sense of the word. The musical repertoire fits perfectly to the texts, which are full of the poetic experience of long-term abuse and disorientation.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms does not always correspond to an increase in body size. The rhachitomous group includes the Leliopsidae, Chigutisaurus, Archaeodontidae, Whatcheeriidae, and Temnospondylia. What is the current relationship between the Rachitomi and the Stereospondyli?\nA.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
