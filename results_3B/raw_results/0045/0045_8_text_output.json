  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early 767. Their stay was most likely part of a deliberate act of self - exil e undertaken by Du because officials in the provincial capital were reluctant to issue a free passage charter on river boats and because he could never be absolutely certain that they would have a free passage out again when they wished to escape. <span class= \"dropecorbisThumbLinkUrl\" href=\"#cite_ref-Kline_12-0\" target=\"_blank\">[ 10 ]</span> On the death ( of a hereditary prince, but likely assassination on Du's part ) in 768 the capital was destroyed after the",
  "Vikram and Shankar\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 has been postponed many times so far and it looks like the delays are not going to end anytime soon for this Shankar movie. The movie is getting ready in post-production process but there are a lot of delays and issues that must be overcome before it can hit the theatres.\nTamil film sources say that at least another 6 \u2013 7 weeks of work is left for the movie but there is no official response from the team. Meanwhile, the VFX and CG team is working flat out to meet the expectations of Shankar. Vikram and Amy Jackson will be seen as heroes and heroines. Amy Jackson\u2019s role would be a vital ingredient when the flick is released and she might have taken up an international brand for sponsorship too, but it would all be clear by the end of this month perhaps. Shankar needs to be satisfied at the final cut. So far, the team has done an amazing job with their post-production work that will be appreciated by fans of the Shankar films. In the meantime, there is another update to this flick and we might hear more about the postponement soon. It must be noted that we have written earlier that a major portion of the story for Vikram will be shot",
  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Who is Du Fu?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. Du Fu was a poet.\nC. Du Fu was a famous general.\nD. Du Fu was a famous governor.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: During the period of Emperor Xuanzong, Du Fu, one of the prominent members of his official circle, became an advisor to him. His relationship with Emperor Xuanzong was quite warm, and Du Fu spent nearly half of his life on official service. He moved from his home in Liangzhou to Chengdu ( capital of Sichuan province ) to stay near the emperor in June 757",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was armed with steam-powered warships, and also fought the Russian Imperial fleet at the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War. The IJN is noted for abandoning conventional, \" wooden-warships \" in the midst of the First Sino-Japanese War for steam and gunpowder -armed vessels. The warships employed steel to improve fire power and firepower while steel -clad vessels such as those present at the battle of Tsushima made the \" iron armada \" nearly indestructible.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Pangean, and B. crassispinum also dates to the late Carboniferous. The earliest known edopoidean, however, Dendrerpeton acerinum, is from the late Mississippian and may not actually be an edopoidean at all, due to some apparent lack of the bone structure typical of edopoidea. Edopoidea lacks more specialized features ; no one branch is derived, and no single lineage or characteristic is the stem. The superfamily is divided into subfamilies, some of which are based on morphology, and others on fossil record alone. Edopoide",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous structures is less significant in many forms ( see below ). What is the context in which the quote is used?\nA. Someone is talking about classifying different groups of turtles.\nB. Someone is talking about the origins of turtles.\nC. No information.\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: C\nExplanation: Temnospondyl was a group of amphibians, now extinct.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the 25th Marines in small groups at first, then swarmed by the men in foxholes holding machine guns and rockets.

Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in and swirl it around lightly. Do this a minute or two with the jar standing upright. You will probably notice that the food color stays pretty much on the bottom of the jar, rather than getting evenly dispersed into the whole glass of liquid.

From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we often struggle with our own personal feelings and emotions. The act, the gesture, the thought will give you an idea how your partner feels to you. And that is, of course, romantic. \"In addition to being the only poet still performing his work, Cohen also performs other great rock classics.\".
