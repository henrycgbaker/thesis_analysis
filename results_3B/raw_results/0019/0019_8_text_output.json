The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for 1859, but were used at the War of 1864.[3][4] [ cite web|url=http://www.cdti99.lt/floating-battery/Limehouse-century-fort.html|title=Floating battery LIMEHOUSE - The century Fort|accessdate=2008-03-29 ] The limeworks gates on Limehouse tubascovered lock in the River Lea serve today as an example of Britain's seventy floating batteries.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units were already in a position behind the North Korean army after the Inchon landing, and were now rapidly advancing across the peninsula toward the North Korean capital.

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 - early spring 767, before setting off again and eventually returning to Jin @'s capital of Luoyang.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was destroyed in the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1894, and played a role in the First Sino&#8211;Japanese War.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not viable, since none of the stereospondyls is rhachitomous, and all stem-groups appear to be rhachitomous [ embryologically at least ]. Finally, sterospondylous forms tend towards simpler vertebrae, while basal Rhachitomi retain the greater complexity seen in Rachispondyli. On the other hand, although fundamental differences in neural arch structure are seen in the Rhachitomi and Stereospondyli, there are other similarities. These include basal, poorly differentiated and loosely interdigitating parapophyses. This has led to",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 95 light AA guns were later added.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the edge of the perimeter, but seven Americans killed one and wounded two others. What may be the main difference between the North Korean and the US secrets?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. North Koreans have allies that have advanced weapons.\nC. North Koreans are less technologically advanced.\nD. North Koreans have more artillery and planes.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Internationally, right-wing rebels often lack effective allies, so they usually spread their own strength rather thinly.

He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \".

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words. However, everybody can parrot or recite by heart some romantic declarations for special occasions. According to, Amandha Dawn Vollmer and Sal Hernandez,\"romantic poetry has the power to change suffering to bliss, death to rebirth, emptiness to endless affection, loneliness to myriad connections, hatred to love, fear to courage, despair to undaunted heart, and darkness to starlight.\" So, if tossed into the mix are declarations of any romantic flavor, from the liners who write love-focused poetry to the poets who write about any subject or topics, the output will be mind-boggling. As noble as they sounded",

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as \" Indiana Jones in black \". Rosenfeld was moved by Warren's \" subtle prose \" and the \" extraordinary psychological dimension \" of the narrative that emphasizes \" the primal bond between mother and child and the killing power of lust and an indulged sensuality \".
