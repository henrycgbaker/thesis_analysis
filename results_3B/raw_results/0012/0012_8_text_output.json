  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which strengthened by 1884 and by 1887 had a dozen first-rate and medium-class ironclads and the Chinese colonies of Canton, Hong Kong, and Macau defied Japanese occupation by the Beiyang Fleet. China launched the Great Joint War against Japan in 1894, compelled the Japanese fleet to make a rapprochement with Russia, and was defeated, which paved the way in 1895 for Britain and France to seize the colonial spheres thus vacated in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Japanese Navy became the most modernized regional fleet, but suffered demoralization from the loss of Chinese capital to",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not easily defined ; the variation in the structure of vertebrae that occur sometimes seems dangerously arbitrary. However, osseous semi - amphibians remain as the basic grouping within Osteolepida, while forms with even simpler vertebrae are included in the suborder Apiosauria. The early agnathans ( such as Panderichthyes ) with extremely simple vertebrae lack a bony cranium and the skull elements become incorporated into the cervical vertebrae. What can be estimated based on the passage?\nA. The passage was written by a stereospondylian.\nB",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter by crawling under the barbed wire to get at the supply crate standing there for lack of an explanation.
