What are some strategies for selecting appropriate analogies and ensuring they enhance understanding rather than confuse the reader? To begin to answer these questions, this book provides a thorough examination of one structural element within written text, analogies. An analogy is a relationship of similarity between two entities--a comparison in which a subjective, unfamiliar entity is equated with a known object; used more widely, the analogy of an abstract idea with an object. Our hopes for understanding analogies in their complexity are almost always dashed. In this concise, accessible volume, the fundamentals of analogies have been systematically examined. Also, the recognition, structure, representation, use, and effectiveness of analogies in written materials are reviewed. Structuralist, genetic, and pragmatic views of",

The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units driven out of the Pusan Perimeter retreated toward the rear and caught up again with the point of attack. In ATO's while in the Pusan Perimeter, the North Korean forces repulsed many attempts at a simultaneous cross - country break through, and blocked plunges towards the Perimeter. From our perspective the REASON was that when North Korean forces attempted to regain the dropped ground that they were doing so with entrenched positions, known about artillery positions, and united with the South Korean Armies with what little reserve and manpower they had. The advantage of attrition, pressure, and maneuver were all in our favor since we",

  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to early 767, visiting some of the local holy men and monks who were clearing the way for Buddhism in what is still the Shi Sect of Daoism. They seem to have found relaxation after their travails, but without doubt he composed many poems to the landscape and people they saw along the way. But in his fulness he paid them homage and stood constantly to his moral integrity, which was elegant and virtuous. That his style is metrical is irrelevant ( Du has no fixed rhythm, and many of the poems here that show metre have it only because they are counted as separate lines in modern editions ) so our point is",

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why did Du Guan temporarily stay in Tonggu?\nA. To recover from surgery.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. To make local acquaintances.\nD. To meet with friends.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Surgical instruments became increasingly sophisticated as the 500s progressed; one type of scapel apparently needed specialized knowledge not found in some regions. Still, Du Guan did not hesitate to travel to local regions in need of poetry or medical advice. Du Guan is a well-connected poet who is very hard to place geographically. The only remaining possibility is that he had somehow injured his leg and needed time to",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which the Japanese soon overpowered in the Battle of Yalu River and the Twlight's Last Gleam during the First Sino - Japanese War.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Elsenfeldian age of the early Carboniferous. The snout is short, and ridge structures resembling ribs are found on the postorbital bones. There is a single occipital condyle, and the intertemporal bone is absent. Its dentary bears a ridge dubbed a 'palatal pinion', which was found on balanerpetontine species by Ole Swinnert von Thal. Edopoids may have been planktonic and filter feeders. Evidence for this is seen in living vertebrates in how they feed, in some species the spines neck, and the bite modifieren in",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is often difficult to make, and various stem taxa, such as australosuchids and platanosuchids, have uncertain phylogenetic status.\nGeneric name : --- Personal experience : --- Source of the quote : This shows how we think evolution works.\nWhat does it imply -\nWhat did it say -\nSource of the quote\nWhat does it imply -\nWhat did it say -\nSource of the quote\nKarikinc\u0131.

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and how it affects our lives.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter. \" They would deliberately advance within ten yards or ten feet, fire once and then withdraw and take cover behind the buildings, \" Schmitt stated in 1997 to Kuban Park of the Yonhap News Agency of Jeju, Korea. What may be the cause of the fiasco that occurred during this episode?\nA. The US withdrew their position because of a deadly attack from North Korea.\nB.
