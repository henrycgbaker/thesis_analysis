Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nDu Fu grew up in a period of constant upheaval. His grandfather was implicated in an anti - Empress Wu (from the Tuoba clan) Revolt, and, as the imperial retinue withdrew from Luoyang to Chang'an, Du Fu fled to his aunt, who was married to an official in Sichuan. Here he grew up neglectful of books and bitter towards his family. At sixteen he obtained the guardianship of his father, the Imperial Prefect governor of Wuxian. One year later he followed him to the capital, where, after a short apprenticeship, he served for about a year in",

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince decades entering a wolf territory is restricted to very few places all around the globe. For scientists, researchers and field biologists, the protection and conservation of wolf populations is only possible when they can conduct research and monitoring in the wild. This way a wolf population is roaming for thousands of kilometres in freedom. But for caretakers of young wolves it is almost impossible. They could lose their packs. So Dr. Wilfried Wemheuer and his associates in preparation of the first great wolf adventure brought parts of a wolf pack to Wolfsburg, who had never been involved with the concept Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke before.",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Carboniferous period.\n Edopoids are relatively small animals. While there are reports of extremes such as {{ culatae proportions and muscle accelerations, perhaps the largest are Geraldokasaurus.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is no longer a reliable signifier of something else. Where did the author work before moving to the job?\nA.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as an artist of language, a figure that Rosenfeld saw as opposing the \" global and globalizing \" notion of language and creativity that current-day postmodernism endorses. Rosenfeld was especially interested in this aspect of Adoff's \"multi-faceted literary art \", pointing out that he \" envisions and dissects the speech of an ethnic Lubavitcher as being intellectually \" radical,\" sharing Argentina's rapidly industrializing environment and dealing with \"the palpable yet largely unspoken frustration of the working class.\" Emerson noted the parallel between Lieber's art ( drawing ) and Alfredo's true, authentic art",
