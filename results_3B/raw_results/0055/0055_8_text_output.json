The phonotaxis ( and other forms of sonar ) in frogs, used to detect and help distinguish prey species, is perhaps a more recent evolutionary development.",
  " Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is \" a fictive figure \", and criticized his critics, saying they are \" digging their own crucible \" by seeking evidence of \" moral motive \" in A. H.'s anti - Semitism, as if this were possible. A Satanic figure, perhaps a character of evil, is not, Steiner says, revised. Why is the critic saying that the Hitler speech is unique?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. It is s a satire against militarism.\nC. It is a satire against Nazism.\nD.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to be used during the Crimean War but participated in the Italian and the American Civil War respectively. Why was captivity totally different for the French floating batteries in the Crimean War?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. The floating batteries were not used by the British\nC. The floating batteries were not used in Italy\nD.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why was Du working in Tonggu at that time?\nA. His money was running out.\nB. None of the above choices.\nC. He was working for a friend there.\nD. He was advancing in poetry there.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The sentence 'In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu (modern Gansu)'indicates that he had been working there at that point in time. This had been a 'happier' or more peaceful place at some point in the past. So that indicates that he was not there then, but must have been there earlier. Financial issues had already arisen",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had landed in Port Arthur from July 31, until 1905, when the Russians had to be beaten out of Port Arthur. In February 1904, the ships of both navies went on the offensive. The Battle of the Yellow Sea occurred August 9, 1904 ; although three modern battleships were sunk outside Port Arthur, the IJN launched incheon, a squadron of battleships, armored cruisers and older cruisers which inflicted losses on the Chinese and Russian forces, winning a decisive victory.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the late Carboniferous. Although this is a very early relative of the true temnospondyls, once it includes the family Cochleosauridae, it also becomes one of the most basal families, sharing an early edopoidean inclination towards loss of jaw articulation and several other characters. All the families have several variations on these themes. However, the genus Pederpes seems relatively more conservative and retains edopoidean characters more closely than most other members. http :// en. wikipedia. org / wiki / Edopoidea The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is primarily a technological artifact, tied together by vague definitions of the limits of the groups. The only clear distinction between these forms concerns the internal structure of the skull : rhachitomous temnospondyls possess a circular fenestra transversa, a supratemporal opening found in many lizard skulls. It is not found in stereospondyls ( with one exception ). What may be the reason temnospondyls are commonly classified this way?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. They are rhachitomous currently\nC.

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 93 anti - aircraft guns were added to the casemates over the mainmast and bridge superstructure. This modification made it possible for the gun mounts to be controlled by either the fire control system or steering layer without having to perform a slow spin to keep them on target. 118mm guns were placed in most of the twelve casemate embrasure openings. In 1944 it was planned for the deck between the inner and outer turrets to be strengthened at the expense of space to allow the placement of a new main control turret. One 152mm Howitzer cannon was attached to the stern which immediately gave rise to the nickname",

Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and how we believe it, in the service of understanding why we believe as we do.\nAs we explore their convictions in the face of mounting evidence their doomsday prediction was a hoax, we also examine other beliefs often deeply held which are, with hindsight, patently ridiculous - such as faith in the psychic abilities of Madame Blavatsky, to follow just one example. This exploration of how we come to believe and the fickle bonds between what we believe and what we know offers a useful and familiar introduction to the fascinating world of neuroscience.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and we could hear them yelling : \"Americans die! \" Powell clung to his foxhole and, as the raids continued through each day, had just time enough to eat, to take shelter from the overhead bombardment, and to sleep.

Hard times are one of the other main reasons for why people tend not to write love poems. I\u2019m sure all other girls would want that too. bab.la is not responsible for their content.
