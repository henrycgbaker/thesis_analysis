  " The first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors, and these features were only gradually abandoned. Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry \" 5 to 9 days coal \", and the situation was similar with the early ironclads. Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle ), and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level. \nThe construction of Warrior also illustrates the transition from wooden to iron hulls. Iron was at first only used for plating, but the invention of the Bessemer process in 1855 allowed for the production of iron plates strong enough to be used for the entire hull. The plates were also thicker than those used in wooden ships, which helped to increase the ships'strength and rigidity. \nThe use of iron for hulls also had the advantage of making it easier to build a hull that was watertight.

The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was being built under the orders of Empress Dowager Cixi, in the First Sino-Japanese War.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not absolute : the most primitive known stereospondyl, the large amphibian Parotosuchus, has rhachitomous vertebrae. As a result, the distinction between these two suborders is no longer considered valid. What is the reason the author thinks the suborder rachitomous is no longer viable?\nA. It is too difficult to classify according to their vertebrae.\nB. The classification is outdated.\nC. It is no longer a valid classification.\nD.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and, using bayonets, tried to penetrate the wire.
