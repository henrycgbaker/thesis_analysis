  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units then advanced in five or six separate columns up through the abandoned positions. What did anyone in the South Korean deploy and use?\nA. They deployed into the South Korean defensive positions.\nB. They all deployed tanks as a strategy.\nC. They deployed into their defensive and offensive positions.\nD.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which threatened Japan's trade with Korea, as well as lending naval support in its successful wars with the Qing Empire. In 1894, with the intent of the shipyard developing domestically, the IJN took the first steps in building its own ironclads and other types of warships. In 1898, anticipating the introduction of the dreadnought principle, it formally raised a new class of ironclads, \" Rodoesha\" ( \u99c6\u9010\u6226-tokenshu-sen).

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the end of the Devonian or the beginning of the Carboniferous.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is based on an argument from functional morphology, and has no phylogenetic evidence whatsoever. What is the reason these methods are no longer viable.\nA. Rhachitomous forms are expected solid size.\nB. These methods are not expected.\nC. PHP and complex reasons used them.\nD.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from literary to simple ; Chou mentions the tenor of a \" poem of concision (), so rich in allusion, of the sortDu Fu made famous in its excellence ( few can emulate it, it is therefore said ), and in addition ( occasionally ) poems of intimacy () \" ( 1955. 124 ). Maimonides noted Du Fu's admiration for philosophical discourse, which is reminiscent of the earlier Song poet Wang Anshi, amidst his foregrounding of sensuous poetic expression, not unlike that of Cao Cao and Shelly. Du Fu therefore seems to foreshadow the Song interest in ideology :",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, love has rung in every penny from the Three Blind Mice to Sweet Caroline.\nWhy would a poem sometimes be considered a surprise invitation?\nThe reason accented publications include publication information is because permission is required.
