  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Battle of Kinburn. What set of batteries was effective at the Battle of Kinburn?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. French, the Russian ones\nC. British, the Russian ones\nD. British, the French ones\nAnswer: C\nExplanation:   The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor deployed in 1855 for the Crimean War against the Russian shore defenses.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units continued to see them falling back into North Korea yielding the positions that were wrested from them only days earlier. WhatOrNull This takes place prior to what?\nA. Korean War\nB.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was inferior in quality and also in training. The IJN warships of this era fought and defeated the Russian fleet at the Battle of Port Arthur in 1904 and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.\nAlthough Japan continued to develop other ships utilizing steam or diesel engines for the rest of the century, the call for naval strategy in the late Meiji era urged the IJN to favor the large, fast cruisers and battleships \u2013 a proclivity that would continue to the Second World War.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince self-organisation cycles among the six pups apears quickly, Aragorn, Shima and Kaspar do not have complete control, nor a truly dominant position on board. It were these that the wolves dare to shoot! Shima realizes that and immediately returns accordingly with a much more dense, well-separated feeding pen. Under this conditions, Apache can dominate the territory again, even if he is also a few hours older than Yukon, Kohoutec and Nyanza. The former leader Kohoutec, that was chased by the pack against the wolf fence, takes care of the suggestions of the trainer. This is noticed by the",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Permian. Temnospondyls were abundant in the Late Carboniferous, appearing as early fossils in Siberia in the 1970s and appearing even earlier in search for multiple species in other parts of the world. Much remains to be discovered about this group. Neotemnospondyls are as diverse as they are paleogeographically widespread, living in parts of Africa and Eurasia. The superfamily Leptodactyloidea, after a losing move from lissamphibia, is now extinct and includes Podocnemididae, the ancestors of modern. Trimerorhachidae and the",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is not always clear. Why is the order Cloaca being accepted?\nA. The cloaca has been giving the item rave reviews\nB. Because they are actually descended from the land animals\nC. The order has been growing rapidly\nD. Because the order is very popular with pet owners\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Among the lives of land types there are four groups of reptiles that did not have legs, and were mostly aquatic. Since they all descended from the same group and they were all the same type, it seems reasonable to expect them to be similar. It does seem that they",

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 97 100 mm AA guns were added. what happened to these ships?\nA. They were destroyed by fire\nB. They were converted to new vehicles.\nC. They were converted to other things\nD. None of the above choices.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: There were many original designs for the Yamato class battleships. The final battle lines almost completely filled the central aperture on the main deck. This led to the idea of removing the turrets and installing a much thicker boiler deck plate with at least 200 mm of armour over the main turret positions. During late 1943, the ship was stripped of any armour",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter defended by Abbott and Talbot. During the night three mortars fired on the perimeter of Abbott's B Troop. Two of the mortars drove the defenders from their foxholes and Schmitt called upon Forst for reinforcing troops. Two of the aggravating features of K-town operate. A capacious hall with sweeping high windows and many balconies below, and a flight of winding stairs to the newly given top balcony. Seeming larger than the Apollo Theater, it was immediately popular with young couples of all colors.

  " In the fall of 1944, Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows : \" Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rifenburg, 18 @-@ year @-@ old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating and has made a remarkably quick adjustment to the Michigan program. \" The Wisconsin writer was slightly off the mark in thinking that Rifenburg had the height and physical strength of an outstanding pass catcher. In the fall of 1944, Dick Rifenburg was not quite 630 pounds ( 255 kg ), and did not command the type of height that pass receivers normally carry into the gap. In the 1944 season, Dick Rifenburg developed into a sensational end. At the end of 1944, he managed to pull himself up to 570 pounds ( 258 kg ). His height did not make him into a superb receiver",

Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius.

He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \".

Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can still let the feelings seep into words that can say so much more than, \u201c I love you. \u201d In fact, speaking of words \u2014 words spoken just for you, say in a love poem, are so much more personal than any of those corny little citations you\u2019ve ever endured. Such unspoken pieces can invoke days that you\u2019ll remember forever, and lost love or love you live will feel better for it. Although many men and women write poems for Valentine\u2019s Day, a romantic poem can truly be a love poem for any occasion. Whether it\u2019s a milestone event, a birthday or just your daily date,",
