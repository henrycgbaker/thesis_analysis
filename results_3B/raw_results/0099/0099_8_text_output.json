  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was equipped with ironclads and battleships during the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Navy developed into a world-class fleet by the time of the Russo-Japanese War, and the end of the war demonstrated that the Japanese Navy was equal to that of any major naval power. The Russo-Japanese War was the first time that light cruisers and torpedo boats were used extensively. The Japanese Navy was the first to develop the scout cruiser, which were replaced by light cruisers after World War I.

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is blurred in later - Triassic forms such as the Plagiosauridae. The group as a whole is now classified as Temnospondyli, from the Greek temnos for \" split \", andpondyli for \" neck and tail \". The name of Rhytidosteidae is preferred for a group of Triassic forms formerly placed in Plagiosauridae, including both forms with simple and complex vertebrae. The pliosaurodont condition is rare, and may be more characteristic of pliosaurs themselves than of the group as a whole. The suborder Stereospondyli",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, fired a few rounds of their weapons into the foxholes, then ran away crying. How would the North Korean infantry attacks be repulsed?\nA.
