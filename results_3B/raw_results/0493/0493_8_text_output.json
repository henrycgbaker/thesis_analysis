  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pressed after them as the road passed through marshland that only American logistics units could effectively handle. The US Navy helped escort the convoys of supply trucks through the Pusan harbor. When Seoul was isolated, Chinese troops began entering North Korea and helping the North Koreans redeploy for battle.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which formed part of the Boxer Rebellion.\nThere were 6 K\u014dtetsu class vessels ordered from Germany on August 23, 1868 and four battleships from England and one battery ship laid down in 1874. The first two Japanese warships named for Great Bear ( Hiei ) and Little Bear ( Kaiko ), respectively were sold and bought back. Following the war of suppression of the Imperial Japanese Army's revolt under Shinsengumi in Osaka, 1870, both ships lost had their main gun removed after they proved ineffective to fight rebels (the Big Bear ), because they sank frequently (Little Bear).",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Devonian period.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not as simple as it once was : some stereospondyls had rhachitomous vertebrae, and some rhachitomorphs had stereospondylous. Which of the following statements about these sea creatures is false?\n A. The classification has been adapted due to recent phylogenetic discoveries.\n B. Rhachitomous vertebrae have numerous bony components.\n C. The number of components has been deemed significant in the classification criteria.\n D.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter from the south towards where units of the 8 th Rifle were posted on our left and east flank -- that is to say almost at our backs! They had been reinforced with heavy weapons including one 100 - mm howitzer!. Our only weapons to work were artillery, aerial fire and air strikes. Only the paraloop in each foxhole could save my skin. There was almost never a lull in the fire as they tried to wipe out groups.

  " Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term \u96c6\u5927\u6210 ( j\u00edd\u00e0ch\u00e9ng- \" complete symphony \" ), a reference to Mencius'description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu's achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \". He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \". Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the intimate colloquial and the lyrically sophisticated verse as often to the stately and restrained of the court and official modes ( a feature that led, in more recent opinion, to the development of \u201c Duist \u201d poems ). This wealth of forms and registers does not belie Du Fu's command over language ; he is untroubled by a conscious aestheticism, writing as smoothly as if the language he uses were a natural extension of his thoughts. He knew full well the force of his own imagery, but with it, if a line overdone as perhaps Ye Muye's is. \" Everything has a place",

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, there are surefire ways to express the love we have for another person, in writing. Love poetry uses direct and indirect reference to romance, desire, connection, and passion. It does not provide the same kind of emotional nourishment for these feelings, though, as experiencing their realisation through another person. Instead of expressing, it interprets and meditates on them, inviting the reader to develop a creative, spiritual appreciation of them, one that\u2019s particularly insightful and sensitive to the inner turmoil and complexity of them that exists only at their fringes. It can show the world\u2019s impact on a particular individual, as individuals experience universal and",
