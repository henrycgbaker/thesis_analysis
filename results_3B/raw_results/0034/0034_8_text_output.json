  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was a major fleet, though the Imperial Japanese Navy was still in training during this time period. In 1894, following the Sino-Japanese War, Japan established a modern industrial base with significant industrial output, and was able to increase her navy, which in turn helped Japan win the First Sino-Japanese War. The first Japanese armored cruiser was purchased in 1907, from the British shipbuilder, Vickers, and named Asama in honour of Mount Asama.

Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince there have hardly been any wolves in their territory since two years ago, Geronimo's first priority is to search for an adult female and to find her a suitable territory that includes the place where Shima and Tazira had lived before the wall was raised. He's not the best at choosing locations. So, Geronimo is lucky, as he quickly finds the adult female, a female called Sanaa who was with her own pack.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Permian period. There is no definitive link between these fossils, so it is possible that they are not direct descendants. The family name is based on a genus of a type of salamander-like amphibian, and refers to a type of salamander called a newt.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls.
