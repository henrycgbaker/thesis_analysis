  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nThis broadening of the scope of poetry was part of the general expansion of culture during the Tang dynasty. The new trend toward broadening the scope of poetry differed from earlier trends toward a more demonstrative or obscure style of poetry like the poetry of Li Po. The development of prose arose at roughly the same time and the spread of prose, in turn, brought about a change in the overall concept of poetry, with prose poems eventually springing up and eventually poetic forms such as the Cuizi becoming an accepted pastoral mode of poetry. \nAs history was viewed by the educated, it was marked by individual achievements, memorable experiences and expansive touristic",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was a formidable force even before it was rebuilt under German command by Kaiser Wilhelm II early in the First World War. On its second clash with Beiyang forces in the Battle of the Yalu River in 1904, the IJN, which was considerably smaller in number, did not fare as well.\nAdmiral Togo Heihachiro formed the plan for the fleet's handling at the Battle of Tsushima ( 1905 ), drawing in fact on the experience gained by the 1883 Campaign of Japan against the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom (see: Battle of the Yanbaru River and Iwami Incident of",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms has no phylogenetic validity. How true is the narrator to the subject\nA. The narrator is misleading\nB.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we do when we become convinced about something, and how we arrive at our own interpretations of the world. The film also examines a little-known aspect of human nature that makes absolutist convictions possible.\nRebecca holds a MSc in social and emotional learning in schools.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came.
