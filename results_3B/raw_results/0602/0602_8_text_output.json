  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nIn addition to his geographical travels, Du Fu became interested in the sciences, studied mathematics and astronomy and became noted in his day for his practical applications of the latter. He is credited with the invention of a gadget called a Du compass. \n1996, Reid Allen Barclay, Eclogue : open letters to Thomas Merton, Pacifica, California : Golden Saffron Press., ISBN 0-932180-08-6, page 139, {{cite book}}: Forthcoming. \n Wikisource has original text related to this article: \nDu Fu : Art and Societ y in Tang Dynasty China\n",

Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n Du Fu lost his father when he was young. Soon after, his mother died of smallpox. During the Chu Tibetan war, around 751 AD, Mang Zu lovers were unsuccessful in attacking the Chu capital, Chengdu, where Du Fu lived when he was a child. Ever after the war, the T ibetan nomads perpetually attacked the countryside. A shell which fell during a major Tibetan attack killed Du Fu's oldest brother ; his grandfather and two younger brothers were also killed in the attacks.

They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the war to be used.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 until April 767, when they took up residence for the last time at Jingxian on the head of Zhesui river on the Jing River gorges just above Luoyang. Before leaving Kuizhou in 767 they composed twenty beautiful poems that they titled \" Li Chun Songs \", which mean songs of Li spring. These songs were composed on a journey on which his ill - @ age and faulty eyesight hindered him ; indeed they were composed in defiance of his exhausted body.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.

None of the above choices.\nB. Chinese history made him distressed.\nC. He became in physical pain due to wealth.\nD.

But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack?

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondyl form is too artificial. Which of the following is true about the structure explained in this passage?\n A. It is a recent structural phenomenon.\n B. It is still used as a topic of discussion.\n C. It is a significant contribution to zoology.\n D.
