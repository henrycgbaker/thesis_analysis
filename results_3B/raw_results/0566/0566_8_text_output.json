  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \nThe family name Du is written \" \u675c \". \" Fu \" is usually read \" Fu \", but in ancient times it could also sound like \" Du \".  The family name \" Du \" is the original surname given to the founder of the Chinese state of Jin. When Jin was conquered by the Zhou state, the Chinese sages suggested changing the family name so it would not be the subject of ridicule by the conquered population. However, as the founder of the state was an important person, his name remained unchanged. Later, another member of the family became emperor of Qi state, and the family name was changed to \" Qi \".

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been built up during the late Qing Dynasty. The 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War pitted these modern warships against one another with the first major victory over Russian warships, the battle of Tsushima Straits, being decided entirely by Japanese forces. In 1921, at the end of the Second Kuomintang civil war between the Beiyang Army of Yuan ShiKai and the National Revolutionary Army of Sun Yat Sen, the Kwantung Army of Japan took control over the entire Manchuria region and declared Manchukuo which was recognized as a Japanese puppet state.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the wolves have already had the opportunity to explore their new habitat they will try to learn to live peacefully on both sides of the fence. In the first weeks and the first months, they will be very nervous and curious to find out new things and get to know each other. The six newcomers might find it difficult to live with so many wolves and might not always follow the rules of the pack and the pack hierarchy in the beginning. Especially the older wolves will not find it easy to accept so many newcomers at a short notice. But with the right treatment and a lot of effort both packs can find a compromise and the two sides are reunited.\n",
  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous.\n The superfamily Mastodonsauroidea includes three families : the Mastodonsauridae, with the genera Neusticosaurus and Mastodonsaurus, and the families Plagiosauridae and Platerosauroididae. Mastodonsauroids show the most radical and advanced changes in temnospondyls in general, including the development of a very large braincase. The genus Neusticosaurus is the oldest species, having been present during the Late Pennsylvania ( approximately 307 million years ago ). Mastodonsauroids were a relatively small group and went extinct at the end",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not clearly defined by morphology at any point. In addition, the Stereospondyli is now recognized as a paraphyletic clade, and is split into two major groups, the Lissamphibia and the Temnospondyli. What was the purpose of putting temnospondyls into different taxonomic groups in the past?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. To create a taxonomic order of them that was more clear\nC.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and why we believe it. And we take a look at some of the more unusual beliefs of history that are still held today. In the process, Right Between Your Ears will take you along a journey through a world you never really thought about or maybe haven't even given much thought to before. A world in which our brains work on a subconscious level, and where our feelings, our emotions, our memories, and even our habits all determine how and what we believe.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter, but the few prisoners the Americans took told different stories. All they had to say for themselves was that their officers had told them to attack the perimeter. Which of the following is true of the American troops?\nA.

He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as narrator : \" For here is the writer as character. For here is the writer as hero. For here is the writer as narrator of the narrator of the story, the storyteller within the storyteller. \" Rosenfeld was also impressed by \" the way in which the narrative moves and changes, constantly shifting levels and dimensions. \" In Rosenfeld's view, the novel is characterized by \" a sense of being on a journey, an unending voyage of discovery, \" and by \" the use of metaphor as a way of making one think about other things than those one may have initially thought about, to make the reader feel and understand",
