  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for use in the Crimean War but entered service with the Mediterranean Squadron in 1863. Also in 1863, the Tyne ironclad bomb vessel Bellona entered service with the Royal Navy. The latter was to have been a float - ing battery powered only by steam, but the design was modified to make it a steam ram vessel when it was noticed that then first - in - doctrine flagship HMS Imperieuse had helped sink the feared battery ship Mastodon by ramming it. In fact the boiler room of Bellona was not finished in time for the type of mission for which it was intended but the gun was",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units crossed a half day in advance of any North Korean Army formations, including tanks. What is the reason for leaving the North Koreans alone?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. His wartime tribulations and the affairs at court in Chang'an made life very difficult for him. Which of these places did Du Fu grow up in?\n A. Sichuan province\n B. Post Dimas\n C. Chang'an\n D.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which opposed the First Sino-Japanese War, and humiliated the Russians in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, a decisive event of the Russo-Japanese War.

  "In the third part of the series \"Mit W\u00f6lfen unter einer Decke\" (i.e. Collaborating with Wolves) a pack of wolves is brought together: the fence between the four pups Tatonga, Nanuk, Yukon and Geronimo on one side and the two pups Apache und Cherokee on the other is opened. Nobody knows what will happen. Until now, Aragorn, Kaspar and Shima had only visited the young wolves. But how will they react if they must share their territory with the six young rowdies permanently in a unified pack? Who will become leader of the pack?\nSince the climax of the first installment, the fence between the two packs was taken down. More importantly the fissures in the pack had become even larger as it was made obvious that the strong personality of Shima hurt a number of the other Social Animals negatively. These factors combined have led to the separation of the packs on one hand and on the other led to Shima being more and more isolated in the Anna's group.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. There has been speculation about a family related to Edopidae, but a close relative to Edops has not been identified. Edops had five fingers on each hind limb which was likely unusual for its time period, even among today's basal tetrapods. Some have contrasted the five finger walking style as strongly edentulous. Some studied Nerlovia embellished with pawprints of Edops or other temnospondyls, however it has been questioned whether it represents mesosaurus impact information or they represented Edops, dysmas, Actopsis or even ray-finned fishes.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is hard to make in fossils ; it appears to be largely a minor character.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we call 'conviction', emotions and thoughts and how they influence our selves. But who is really right? Are the amygdalas behind our every conviction or that of our brain's prefrontal cortex? Which parts of our brain control our emotions and enable us to make rational assessments to guarantee our well-being in a world that is spinning round? And who monitors us so that we can keep the knowledge of our foibles in check? The topics of online bullying, conspiracy believers, rational thinking and neuroscience are merged in this political, controversial but above all thrilling radio series to show that denial and agreement are emotions that are deeply rooted in us",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and Schmitt used the mortars under his command to kill close to two dozen until counter-attack units finally came up from points south.
