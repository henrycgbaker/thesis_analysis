  " Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 765 to the end of 766 when a boat passed up the river and they made the remaining journey to Luoyang. And as it will be for many in the future, Du Fu died in Luoyang. And as in Luoyang, he bequeathed his belongings to a family far away from him, the Chen family of Huiji ( in what is now southern Hebei ) who offered shelter for almost forty years, until they finally took the poet's body back to his birthplace, Luoyang. \" He did the proper Buddhist funeral rites, \" says Li.

Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which it defeated decisively during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, leading to China's significant loss of territory. By the end of the 1890s, Japan had the third largest fleet in the world in terms of tonnage. However, Japan's navy lagged behind the United Kingdom and, with even less naval power than the United States, the Japanese saw that the race to build the largest and most advanced fleet was futile. In 1905, at the Battle of Tsushima, Japan decisively defeated Russia's Pacific fleet at the cost of many of Russia's dreadnoughts.",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Silurian epoch. The oldest species in the order is Microphasaurus which appears in the Lower Permian. Edopoidea and Cochleosauroida (see below) have both lost their upper temporal fenestrae, which is an apomorphic characteristic present ancestrally amongst temnospondyls. The family Cochleosauroidae or paracochleosaurus is a derived clade within Edopoidea. The name of the family derives from the presence of paracochlea in many of the species.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is shown, by molecular analysis, to be artificial. What is the explanation of the author's discussion?\nA.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we find so compelling about our strongly held beliefs, what happens when we're confident we're right, and why we're so prone to give away everything we care about to a cause, a person, or a message we believe in. Host Mireille Silcoff, author of The Better Mother, speaks with two people each episode: a \u201cbeliever,\u201d the passionate advocate of an opinion or cause, and a \u201cskeptic,\u201d someone who examines beliefs with critical logic.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter.

This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Mix it and stir it and shake it and it refuses to mix. This is because one liquid is more dense than the other. It sinks, which will not occur in this experiment. The only thing that can accomplish this is gravity.\nAs shown in this graph, the density of water is less than the density of oil.

  "How does the Most Accurate Estimate compare to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Total System's earnings prospects, and what impact could this have on the stock's near-term price?\nGenerate according to: Total System Services (TSS - Free Report)\tis expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1.16 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Total?\nFor Total, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to convincingly predict that Total will beat the consensus EPS estimate",

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as both the story's central figure and its unnamed narrator. This novel has nothing in particular to say about human nature, nothing to say about Hitler or the Jews, but something to say about the art of speech, and we should appreciate the way Lieber as narrator uses his knowledge of words to create a reality that the reader can identify with. Rosenfeld said he 'd love to see more people reading The Portage, since it shows how the text can enrich our understanding of language. What may be the reason of reading such a novel?\nA.
