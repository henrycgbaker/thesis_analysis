  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late. The modern military use began in 1894 with the United States Navy. Floating batteries would, in the 1920s and 1930s, be decommissioned or removed and replaced with moored batteries.

On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms affected only the early Triassic forms. What did I have originally named these groups according to?\nA.

Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver.

Ever notice how Reeko occasionally writes \u2018lead ins\u2019 to the experiments that have absolutely nothing at all to do with the experiment?\nWhy does the oil float on the water rather than mixing with it? This experiment will take some of the mystery out of this phenomenon.\nTake a jar of water and put a drop of food coloring in it. Now take a drop of black-ink to make this a bright, dark color. Now add a tablespoon or two of liquid dishwashing detergent.\nAfter a moment you\u2019ll notice a clear zone of water/dish soap next to the darker liquid. And remarkably, if the drop and water areas are of similar sizes, you\u2019ll get a clear area at the interface of two different densities.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic wordsmithery, the Internet's out there, so like the flowers of today, if we are in search of the most seemingly unknown romance poem of all time, we can go to it within minutes. Of course, there are other significant poets like John Milton and Lord Byron who also penned their amorous feelings down while creating sublime works of satisfying literature. There are \"'even\" those who support same-sex relationships, who argue that if man can love man, poles can couple for passion.\nDefinition of Romantic Love Poem \u201cA poem, lyric, or sonnet is a thing of beauty that awakens the heart.\u201d( Sadim El Se",

The Panthers needed today's win to keep their state tournament berth chances alive and need to win their final two matches tomorrow and Thursday to make it a reality.\nThe team played extremely well with their top six scores 5 over or better.
