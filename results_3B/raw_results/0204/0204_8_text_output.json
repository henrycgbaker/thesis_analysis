The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late for the Crimean campaign, but were first deployed in the 1857 Ashantee expedition, where they demonstrated their superiority as armoured vessels in coastline battles. In peacetime, both batteries were transferred to the Mediterranean as part of the British ironclad squadron there. Due to the lack of iron, the batteries were built entirely using wood, although the constructions themselves proved to be surprisingly durable, unlike most wooden warships. The armour was often, for some reasons believed necessary, but the French decided to counterbalance the hidden armour plate of the battery against heavy projectiles from the shore forts with thick walls, reinforced with extra plates and",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was patrolling the Yellow Sea during the Sino-Japanese War. This was the IJN's first foreign naval encounter, and the Japanese navy had a relatively successful outcome because of its training and battle experience in domestic open waters. The treatment of foreign naval vessels by the chinese navy was therefore a very significant factor in Japanese naval development and use of ironclads.\nThe naval staff of the IJN initiated a navy wide program of modernisation in 1895, four years after the failure of their navy in the Sino \u2013 Japanese War of 1894-95. Some critics accused the navy ministers and admirals of",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is artificial, as many so - called stereospondyls were rhachitomous, and vice versa, so that the artifical construction is outdated. What is the reason for believing that the terms Rachitomi and Stereospondyli are no longer viable?\nA. They point to an unrealized concept from an old nomenclature.\nB. Other issues have arisen.\nC.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we still know these lines of our poets are just as expressive in their own way. \"No man has ever written a love poem that did not finish, \u201cmy love, I wish I were dead!\u201dLangston Hughes. Love is nothing, if not unconditional, and in most cases romantic love is distressingly short-lived in mind or heart.
