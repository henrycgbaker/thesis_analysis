Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli.

He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as a \" moral and political guide \" to the narrator, and the way in which Lieber's \" moral authority \" is \" undermined \" by his \" moral and political blindness \".
