The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was also armed with ironclads in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895).

Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls.

Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Early Carboniferous. The genus Balanerpeton was first described in 1935, but it wasn't until the 1980s that it was confirmed as a temnospondyl.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is not as clear as previously thought. The stereospondylous condition is found in many primitive forms, and is not confined to the group. The classification of temnospondyls into two major groups has also been questioned, as some forms that were previously considered stereospondyls have been shown to be rhachitomous. Based on the structure of their vertebrae, temnospondyls are now classified into three suborders : Stereospondyli, which includes the Stereospondylidae and the Trematosauridae ; Rhachitomi, which includes the Brachyop",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
