  " Most of what is known of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n His father Du Tai ( \u675c\u6cf0 ), a scholar - official who attained the rank of fu ( governor of a province ), was subsequently placed under house arrest as a punishment for some impermissible behaviour, and the family suffered a heavy income loss. A mediocre artist, Du Tai preferred life as a scholar to that of a government official. Poems with similar themes later led to Du Fu's father's early death. As the family had several sons, it was naturally usual for Du Fu and his six brothers to be given boys'names. His generation received the noble hereditary name of Du Daoheng ( \u675c",

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in the Crimean War to be used but were still in the logbook of the Admiralty as of 1876. The French floating batteries were known for their violent personalities and often undermined each other while on active service. What names were used for the French floating batteries in active service in the Crimean War?\n[[AlternativeAnswers: Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation. None of the other floating batteries used in the War were deployed in the Crimean War, so the French batteries in use were the only ones in the list, though unsucessful, they were theoretically quite effective.]]\n[[AlternativeAnswers",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Late Devonian, though many have questioned its correct placement as a temnospondyl, instead, some place it among apoda or lissamphibia in the phylum Amniota.\nBalanerpeton is a genus of titanosuchian direct-developing amphibian. Some authors believe that the name derives from a Doric term meaning \"mere stranger.\" Its bones consist of cartilage, which makes examining the internal anatomy difficult. The beak is made of keratin, and has distinct canines for animal browsing. Analysis of the hormonal balance during the reproductive cycle suggested that the animal was a pitviper,",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae cannot be mapped directly on lower numbers of bones in the skeleton.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe and why we become so convinced.

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
