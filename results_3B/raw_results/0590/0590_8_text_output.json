  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late at the Battle of Bomarsund (1860) to operate. Their next deployment in the war was with the bombardment of the island of Klagenfurt (1864).\nWhen the Italian Army stationed in Algeria rebelled against French rule in 1871, the French sought an excuse to expand the colonial presence in Tunisia.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them.

The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had been sent to the Far East, in the First Sino-Japanese War. Armored cruisers played a role during the Russo-Japanese War, but ironclads were ultimately deprecated in favor of low silhouette dreadnought battleships constructed in its own Japanese shipyards.

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the conodont zone Aulacopleuriceras microsacciformis. Other specimens from the Middle Pennsylvanian include Gerrhosauromorpha, Amarolepis, Tanystropheus, Stygocephalus, and Abrictosaurus, among others. At the base of the Dipsjnian, the family Cochleosauridae itself is represented by the single genus, Anteosauridae ( the \" pseudo - Permian \" genus Prolacerta emphaticus is not valid ; this genus belongs in Crocodylomorpha ), which give rise to the best evidence for the basal group Tem",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not an absolute one.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter with a stolen jeep and threw the ugliest grenades I've ever seen.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words that can instantly ignite our imaginations, it\u2019s still easy to write the feeling that actually comes from the heart. It is enough that you write from the heart to express what you truly feel for your beloved.
