Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family. \n However, by the time of Du Fu's birth in 712, Chang 'an was occupied by Arabs, Persians, Turks, Uygurs and Uyghurs tribes. The Latin name of Chang 'an was Peking, at that time. Only in 882 did the Tang dynasty officially move its capital to Chang an.

  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late in April 1859 to be of use. The Italian navy dissolved the battery in June 1860. The slow speeds and short range of the early ironclads in general meant that they were not always effective, and they probably ought to have been absorbed into their supporting wooden fleet rather than treated as a separate entity. - - - -\nwiki:Category:Ironclad_batt\u2026\nIronclad batt\u2026\nFrance#Culture\ncinema#Battle_of_Kinburn\n\ub4dc\ub77d\ud2c0 baryluk / bastiaan leegstra / Bernard Wuillemin / Ekaterina B\u00f6hm / Elke Pau",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Why would the narrator be happy in Sichuan?\nA. There he had friends to host him.\nB. He had financial help from friends.\nC. He had a job there.\nD. He was a guest of the governor general.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: In countries where the Confucian ideology ruled, Chinese emperors often awarded honors to their courtiers and scholars, welcoming them and their families to their palaces for a period of time. This enabled the composers to rest from their everyday duties, study new ideas, and connect with fellow scholars and poets. Many of these writers would then produce some of the finest",
  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which blockaded the Jiaozhou Bay in 1894-95 and defeated it decisively at the Battle of the Yalu River. Additionally, they added older warships, like wooden - hull, pre -dreadnought battleships to strike a balance against the predatory maritime trade of the United States Navy. Some of the battleships and armored cruisers were later fitted with electric generators that turned them into superirons, which fought the fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. However, by 1914 the IJN was outclassed by foreign navies and retreated to shore",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the early Middle Devonian.  In this time window, the main land was composed of edges that where rifted from the main land and were attached to it by narrow threaded mountain ranges.  The remainder of these taxons have their origin in the Devonian ; Tarasemys and Marasuchus popped to the surface and became the first representative of the superorders Stereospondyli and Rhinesuchia respectively.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous forms is artificial as is shown by the fact that some stereospondylous forms have lost or reduced some of their vertebrae. It is now traditional to classify temnospondyls into reptiliomorphs, edaphosauromorphs, and euperygidans. The reptiliomorphs include not only the primitive forms with rhachitomous vertebrae, but also transitional variants with both rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae. The edaphosauromorphs are tetrapods which roamed land as fossorial, burrowing, and predator",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter to crawl toward us for surrender. The Chosin provided medical care for them. Not a black soldier had been lost to us for 19 days. The situation remained tense and dangerous, and the seriousness of our situation became more clear. The medical personnel treated about 2 casualties for mixed wounds which included those caused by accidents and combat.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, such emotions demand to be put through expressed words from the heart. Believe it or not, writing love poems can serve a sort of therapeutic purpose to balance ones emotions.\n  1.

  " Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \" breakthrough work \" that \" astonishes \". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \" landscape of speech \" \u2014 the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \", and the latter, \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person.

He said The Portage is Lieber's \" novel \", and uses him as a catalyst for a thick historical critique that shows how the Huber family has been affected by European history.
