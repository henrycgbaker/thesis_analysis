  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which had occupied the Liaodong peninsula in 1894 at the Battle of the Yalu River which concluded an armistice. This marked the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, From this point, it became clear that the empire would have to develop its own shipyards if it was to ever avoid dependence on overseas powers. The Russian Baltic Fleet and the Austrian fleet of 1909 each included a single Dreadnought but the Imperial Japanese Navy which had originally relied heavily on foreign-built vessels since the Meiji era eventually attempted to construct its own battleships at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries,",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous temnospondyls is blurred at the base of the clade. Why does the narrator want to study the history of temnospondyls?\nA.
