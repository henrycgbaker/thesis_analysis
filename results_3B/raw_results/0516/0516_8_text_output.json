  " Du Fu's compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, \" everything in this world is poetry \", Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems. \nAnd Du Fu was also a unique poet among Han Dynasty poets, for he wrote both classical style poems and free verse poems. Thus, he was considered as a poet who likened himself to the earlier poet Guo Ju who also wrote some classical style poems. In the late period of the Han, poets often simply labelled everything as \" poetry \" ( as did many poets during the Tang Dynasty ), and pointed out an extremely moderate poetic style as the ideal.

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units'pace slowed dramatically as they cautiously pursued the withdrawing enemy. What changes did the U. S. eventually make to its forces?\nA. They changed their order's.\nB. They changed their pace.\nC. None of the above choices.\nD.

They traveled slowly, held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ). They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 764, probably because of the bad weather in the mountains in the fall.

  " In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ). He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. What am I thinking about at the moment?\nA. None of the above choices.\nB. I am in high school.\nC.

  " Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The K\u014dtetsu ( Japanese : \u7532\u9244, literally \" Ironclad \", later renamed Azuma \u6771, \" East \" ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was gathering in Korea for the invasion that led to the Sino-Japanese War and, much later, in the Russo-Japanese War. Several IJN warships saw action against the Russians at the Battle of Tsushima Straits in May 1905. However, most IJN ironclads and armored cruisers were built from the thought-out plans of the European navies and, as such, were inferior to the most modern of the Continental navies. Ultimately the Japanese-built armored cruisers were also thrown into the Battle of Tsushima, which resulted in the defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy and the Japanese victory that created",

  " The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Emsian to Givetian stage ( late Lower Devonian mid - Pennsylvanian Series ), and is around 450 million years old. Dendrerpetontid temnospondyls are most closely related to the superfamily Capitosauroidea. Cochleosaurids are known from Europe, Zimbabwe, and North America, and are common in the Late Pennsylvanian Series of Europe and the Early Permian Series of North America. Despite an extensive rhythmicity of forms and a general geographic distribution, cadenceau\n has a more ancestral reptilian hepatic ventricle. contrary, the p",

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is of little use in predicting skeletal morphology, especially among younger temnospondyls. In conjunction with a geometric morphometric study of the dentition, it is suggested that cranial or postcranial characters should be employed in conjunction with a molecular hypothesis in examining the phylogeny of temnospondyls.

  " The rear turrets, the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added, a total of 57 guns.

  "How do we become convinced that we are right? And what does if feel like to be wrong, to have our convictions challenged? Through the eyes of people who became convinced the world would end on May 21, 2011, Right Between Your Ears explores the timeless topic of how people believe, how we turn beliefs into certainties, and mistake them for the truth. A stock trader with a young family, a philosophy student who is about to graduate, a retail manager who became so convinced she quit her job of 18 years... Against the backdrop of their extraordinary stories, neuroscience and social psychology offer additional insight into what we believe, when they become certainties, and why they can get in the way of rational thinking. Belief - whatever it is we believe in - often determines our everyday lives and future. We live it, if we don t change it. Do we ever have a chance of changing it? - Harvard professor Tara Marshall investigates how we become convinced, overcoming cognitive biases and obstacles to rational thinking.

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the foxhole while man numbers led them to believe it was devoid of defenders.

  "Could you paraphrase the statement \"Romantic poetry comes from the heart and is an expression of the poet\u2019s perceptions, opinions, and emotions\"? : Through the ages, romantic men took their pens and wrote lovely poems for their beloved. From love at first sight to heartbreaks, poets have written about the mystery of love. As such, love poems will continue to exist as long as there are poets. The great poets have written plenty of beautiful lines with their rhymes and allegories that we can use to put words to the passions that love inflames within us. Although we are not all blessed with the gift of poetic words, we can always express our love in terms that our loved ones can understand.
