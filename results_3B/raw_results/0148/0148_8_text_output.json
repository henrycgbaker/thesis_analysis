  " The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave, Tonnante and D\u00e9vastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to see service in the Crimean War and stayed in harbor. Their role was demonstrated in 1878 during the Russo - Turkish War, where plenty of practice had been under taken at the time by the Royal Navy who ships of the line arriving in the Eastern Mediterranean in order to set up the siege of Epirus\n 1859:       Italy's invasion of France marched north;                    France deployed wooden battelines\n 1859:       The Austrian fleet was completely destroyed by a large           The German design featuring circular gun aircraft\n naval force consisting of large wooden ships of the Italian\n line, French lineships and British cruis",

  " The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18 \u2013 19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units pursued, and by September 20 the Americans rode into the North Korean port town of Wonsan.

The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers.

  " Originally, temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms, with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements, were placed in the suborder Rachitomi, and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics, this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods, and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover, the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not phylogenetically significant ; instead, each is derived. All modern vertebrates have complex vertebrae, deriving from a more primitive condition in which vertebrae were made up of multiple separate elements. In primitive amphibia exposed in several fossil deposits, there is a macroevolutionary transition between this single - element condition and two fused elements. The numerous intermediate forms between archaebatrach diapsids and modern tetrapods have no unique anatomical traits that could be used to identify them as precursors of modern diapsids. These omniphyletic transitions within the tetrapod",

  " The third day, September 3, the situation worsened. The weather was hot and ammunition, food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted. Since the previous afternoon, North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units.
